Born in Syracuse, New York, and raised in Grapevine, Texas, Post Malone gained fame after releasing the single “White Iverson” on SoundCloud in February of 2015.  In an interview with Noisey, Post explains how he got his stage name:  I was looking for a name ‘cause I already have all these songs done and I couldn’t think of anything, so I put my name in a rap name generator and it said “Post Malone.”  Post discussed releasing a debut album in March of 2016, but after various setbacks, the album never came to fruition. In its place, on May 12th, 2016, he released his first mixtape, August 26th, to critical acclaim. He eventually released his debut album, Stoney, on December 9th, 2016.

Drake is part of a generation of rappers, along with Wiz Khalifa, Kid Cudi and others, who came up through internet mixtapes. Drizzy put out three mixtapes from 2006 to 2009: Room for Improvement, Comeback Season, and So Far Gone. These mixtapes got him the attention of Lil Wayne, and spawned the hit singles “Forever” and “Best I Ever Had,” the latter coming from his critically acclaimed mixtape So Far Gone. During this period, Drake also made a slew of guest appearances on tracks by artists from DJ Khaled to JAY-Z.  After years without a record deal, Drake finally signed to Lil Wayne’s Young Money Entertainment label in 2009. The next year, he released his debut album Thank Me Later. His second album, Take Care, was released in November 2011 and ultimately led to celebration with his crew for earning his first Grammy Award (for Best Rap Album). The album has been certified 4x platinum as of March 29, 2016. His third studio album, Nothing Was The Same, was released September 24th, 2013. Two years later on February 13, 2015, Drake released If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late. Just months after that, he released a collaborative mixtape with American rapper Future, called What A Time To Be Alive. His fourth studio album, Views, was released on April 29, 2016. Following the release of Views, Drake announced the release of his new “playlist,” More Life, on OVOSOUND Radio. It was released on March 18, 2017.  On January 19, 2018, Drake surprisingly released a two-track EP, which was titled Scary Hours. In the following weeks Drake would make a song with his friend BlocBoy JB called “Look Alive”, the song would debut at #6 on the billboard and would mark Drake’s 23rd Top 10 Billboard hit. After “God’s Plan” debuted and spent 11 consecutive weeks at #1 on the Billboard, Drake released “Nice For What” to continue the streak of a successful 2018. “Nice for What” would go on to replace “God’s Plan” as the #1 song on the Hot 100. Drake went on to release his fifth studio album Scorpion on June 29, 2018. It featured 25 tracks and was released as a double album. Upon release, it set the single day album streaming record on both Apple Music and Spotify and broke the first-week streaming record for an album in a mere three days. That week, a record-shattering seven songs from the album placed in the Billboard Hot 100’s top ten.  In a December 25, 2019 interview with Rap Radar, Drake confirmed upcoming music. He followed this statement up by releasing two songs with Future, “Life is Good” and “Desires,” on January 10, 2020, and January 31, 2020, respectively. A month later, Drake would drop two tracks: “When to Say When” and “Chicago Freestyle.” On April 3, 2020, Drake released “Toosie Slide,” the first official single from his upcoming material.

Drizzy has also been involved in many beefs, including ones with Common and Tyga. His most eventful beef was with Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill. This started the whole conspiracy over “Drake has a ghostwriter.” Drake fired back immediately with “Charged Up” and with no response from Meek, he dropped another diss track four days later titled “Back to Back.” Meek then released his diss track titled “Wanna Know.”. Drake was nominated for a Grammy for “Best Rap Performance” for “Back to Back.”",https://images.genius.com/fc7fecd8b3701bdc9e1eb077cbf1181c.1000x1000x1.jpg,14982
Juice WRLD,"Jarad Anthony Higgins (December 2, 1998 – December 8, 2019), popularly known as Juice WRLD and originally JuiceTheKidd, was an American rapper from Calumet Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. Juice was first signed to Internet Money Records then subsequently signed to Interscope in March 2018. His main and closest producers were Nick Mira and SIDEPCE (who is now known as DT).  In an interview with Mass Appeal, Juice WRLD explained how he came up with his stage name:  I had the haircut, like the ‘Juice’ cut Tupac had in the movie.  In an interview with BigBoyTV, Juice furthered:  Part of the reason why I kept ‘Juice’ in my name wasn’t only for Tupac. It was for three rappers, actually: Tupac, Soulja Boy had an old mixtape called Juice, and MC Juice.  He expanded on the shortening of “world“ to “WRLD“ later in the BigBoyTV interview as well, stating:  That was like a social media handle, and they wouldn’t let me spell the “world“ right. Eventually, it kinda got some meaning behind it. I was just thinking about it one day, and I kinda just said, “my music is kind of an illustration of what my world is and what goes on in my world.“  The rapper first gained major popularity from his December 2017 track “All Girls Are The Same,” which garnered even more recognition when popular Lyrical Lemonade video director Cole Bennett made a music video for it. Juice is often compared to Post Malone for his similar sounding voice and style.  Juice had stated within an interview with No Jumper that his favorite artist is Chief Keef and his favorite album is Kanye West’s November 2008 hit, 808s & Heartbreak.  Juice’s debut studio album, Goodbye & Good Riddance was released in May 2018, featuring productions from Mira, benny blanco, Cashmere Cat, Cardo, Taz Taylor along with other prestigious producers. The album was supported by five singles, garnering his biggest Billboard Hot 100 hit “Lucid Dreams,” which slowly climbed the charts and peaked at #2 on the charts. Additionally, four other tracks off the album – namely “Lean wit Me,” “Wasted"" featuring Lil Uzi Vert, “Armed and Dangerous,” and “All Girls Are the Same“ – peaked at #68, #67, #44, and #41, respectively.  The success of Juice’s debut studio album followed soon after with the release of October 2018’s Future-assisted collaborative project, Future & Juice WRLD Present… WRLD ON DRUGS, more commonly known as simply WRLD ON DRUGS. The album saw four Billboard Hot 100 charting tracks – “Make it Back“ (#92), “Jet Lag“ (#72), “Astronauts“ (#82), and the highest charter at #26, “Fine China.“  Juice’s second studio album, Death Race for Love, saw its daylight in March 2019, which became his first project to top the Billboard 200 chart, selling 165,000 equivalent album units within the first week. It featured only two previously released tracks: “Robbery,"" which dropped with the music video on Valentine’s Day, and a tropical-vibed “Hear Me Calling.” Death Race For Love saw six different tracks chart within the Billboard Hot 100.  On December 8, 2019, Higgins suffered a seizure at Midway International Airport in Chicago. He was pronounced dead shortly after. He was set to release his highly-anticipated third studio album the same month, supported by its lead single, “Bandit” with YoungBoy Never Broke Again, but never did so.  Over a month after his tragic death, the rapper’s posthumous vocals found their place on “Godzilla” from Music to Be Murdered By, an album by Juice’s lifelong idol, Eminem. A month later, Juice was featured alongside his second-time collaborator Lil Uzi Vert and first-time collaborator Chance the Rapper on his multiple-time collaborator G Herbo’s album title track, “PTSD.” The next month, Juice appeared on YNW Melly’s “Suicidal (Remix).“ The following month, Juice’s label dropped two singles – “Righteous“ and “No Me Ame“, the latter of which was alongside frequent collaborator Rvssian and new collaborator Anuel AA. The next month, Juice’s vocals were featured on Polo G’s track “Flex.“ His label followed up later that month with his Trippie Redd-assisted track, “Tell Me U Luv Me.“  Early in July 2020, Juice’s label began hinting at his first posthumous album, and dropped two more promotional singles within a span of two days, respectively titled “Life’s a Mess“ – which featured past collaborator Halsey – and the Marshmello-assisted track “Come & Go.“  All of these posthumous tracks found their positioning on his 21-track album, Legends Never Die, which released on July 10, 2020, over 8 months after his passing. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, selling nearly 500,000 album-equivalent units in its first week.  Legends Never Die would mark the largest posthumous album debut to date.  Additionally, Juice joined The Beatles and Drake to become the third artist with five tracks in the Top 10 at the same time, with Marshmello-assisted “Come & Go” at #2, “Wishing Well“ at #5, “Conversations“ at #7, Halsey-assisted “Life’s A Mess” at #9, “Hate The Other Side,“ with Marshmello and featuring The Kid LAROI and Polo G at #10.  Just under 4 weeks after the drop of Legends Never Die, Juice’s long-time dream of collaborating with R&B singer The Weeknd came true with their hit track “Smile”, which released on August 7, 2020.  On December 2, 2020, the day that would mark Juice’s 22nd birthday, his label surprise dropped the benny blanco-assisted “Real Shit,“ which would mark the pair’s fourth officially released collaboration.  The label followed six days later on December 8, 2020 – the day that marked the first anniversary of Juice’s passing – for another joint track with The Kid LAROI, titled “Reminds Me Of You.“  Grade A continued Juice’s legacy in 2021 with the Young Thug-assisted track “Bad Boy,“ which released on January 15, 2021. Additionally, the official music video marked the final collaboration between Cole Bennett and Juice WRLD. One week later, DJ Scheme released the deluxe of his collaborative album FAMILY, on which the two collaborated for the opening track “Buck 50.“",https://images.genius.com/42b0e9b115b685c8dd7e7f32e3f1ce9c.999x999x1.jpg,4593

Harry Styles,"Harry Edward Styles (born February 1st, 1994) is a widely-recognized English singer, songwriter and up-and-coming actor. He rose to fame during his time with One Direction—a platinum-selling, world-renowned boy band. Since the band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2015, Styles has produced two chart-topping studio albums and launched his acting career. He is credited with writing music for Ariana Grande, the 2018 rom-com Love, Simon, Meghan Trainor, One Direction, himself and more.  Styles was born and raised in Redditch, Worcestershire with his sister, supported by their loving mother and step-father. Growing up, Styles always had a passion for singing; he would record covers on his karaoke machine as a kid and went on to be the lead singer of Manchester band White Eskimo. In 2010, 16-year-old Styles auditioned as a solo artist on The X Factor before judge Simon Cowell grouped him with four other boys to form English-Irish pop boy band, One Direction.  In April 2017, two years after One Direction announced their hiatus, Styles dropped his debut solo single “Sign Of The Times” which was greeted with enormous praise as the song landed the number one spot on the charts in over twenty countries. Influenced by rock bands such as Pink Floyd, Fleetwood Mac and The Rolling Stones, Harry Styles’s self-titled debut album immediately shot to the top of the charts upon its release in May 2017, landing the number one position in 84 different countries along with selling a historic, record-breaking 230,000 album units.

Taylor Swift,"One of the defining artists of the 2010s, Taylor Alison Swift, born December 13th, 1989, is an American singer-songwriter and actress who has achieved success in both country and pop. Raised on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at age fourteen to pursue a career in country music. Scott Borchetta signed Swift to his then-nonexistent label Big Machine Records after seeing her perform at the Bluebird Cafe in November 2004.  Swift debuted in June 2006 with “Tim McGraw,” an ode to a lover who would be leaving town. The song served as an introduction to her self-titled debut album, which touched upon topics like heartbreak and bullying Swift faced at school. Her honesty and relatability appealed to fans from all walks of life, and went on to become the longest-charting album of the 2000s, spending 227 weeks on the Billboard 200.  Swift’s sophomore effort, Fearless, came in November 2008 and cemented her status as a country superstar, while tracks like “Love Story” and “You Belong With Me” also garnered mainstream attention. Not only did the record become her first number one, but it also became the most-awarded country album of all time, winning accolades such as the Grammy award for Album of the Year. Until Billie Eilish’s 2020 win, then-20-year-old Swift was the youngest person to have ever received the honor.  Following the success of Fearless, some had doubts about Swift’s songwriting abilities, and Swift wrote her third album, Speak Now, alone to prove herself. It became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist in the U.S., selling over 278,000 digital downloads in its first week, and although it lost critic’s-choice awards like the ACM Album of the Year and Grammy for Best Country Album, it saw great success at fan-influenced shows like the Billboard Music Awards.  Before releasing Red in October 2012, Swift began straightening her signature curly hair, signaling a new era in her personal life and career. After going through a whirlwind heartbreak, she channeled her emotions into fan-favorite songs like “All Too Well,” which Rolling Stone named as the best song of the 2010s. Despite being a cult-classic, Red infamously lost the Grammy for Album of the Year, pushing Swift to change her sound and approach to music.  October 2014’s 1989 was Swift’s official entrance to the pop music scene, and it cemented her status as a musical titan, becoming the only album of 2014 to sell over a million copies in its first week and spending five non-consecutive weeks at #1. She also won the coveted Grammy for Album of the Year, using her acceptance speech to applaud hard-working women and becoming the first woman to win Album of the Year twice, and for different genres. Lead single “Shake It Off” became one of her biggest hits, earning Swift her first diamond single by March 2020.  Around the time of her triumphant Grammy win, Swift became entangled in a highly-publicized feud with rapper Kanye West, who claimed that his interrupting her speech at the 2009 Video Music Awards was what “made [her] famous” on his track “Famous.” After standing up for herself and claiming West never told her he would call her a “bitch” on the song, the public turned against Swift and began calling her things like a “snake” and a liar on social media.  Following the backlash, Swift took a hiatus from the spotlight, breaking her typical cycle of releasing an album every two years. During this time, Swift worked on songs like “This Is What You Came For,” which she wrote for then-boyfriend Calvin Harris under a pseudonym, “Better Man,” which she wrote for country group Little Big Town, and “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever,” a collaboration with ZAYN that appeared in the film Fifty Shades Darker.  In August 2017, Swift took a DJ who groped her to court, after he tried to sue her for defamation. She counter-sued for a symbolic $1 and the jury decided in her favor. Swift told TIME that she went through with the trial to stand in solidarity with other survivors of sexual assault, which was especially poignant in the face of the #MeToo Movement that was rising at the time.  Just days after the case concluded, Swift wiped her social media accounts to tease the release of “Look What You Made Me Do” and her sixth studio album, November 2017’s reputation. Despite the previous summer’s conflict, the record had her biggest sales week to date, debuting at #1 and selling 1.2 million copies in the U.S. in its first week, more than all the other 199 albums on the Billboard chart combined. It also went on to become the best-selling U.S. album of 2018, despite its 2017 release, and won accolades like the American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Album.  reputation was Swift’s last album with Big Machine Records before signing with Republic Records. Following her new contract, Scott Borchetta sold Big Machine Records to entertainment mogul Scooter Braun. Swift took to social media to describe her disappointment, but vowed to re-record the albums Braun purchased so she could be the full owner.  Swift’s dedication to artistic ownership became a large focus of the Lover era — she co-produced most tracks on the album, as well as directing or co-directing each music video, including “ME!” and “Lover.” Swift also became politically vocal, starting with an October 2018 Instagram post about the U.S. midterm elections and continuing with acts like her support of the LGBT community on “You Need to Calm Down.”  In November 2019, the American Music Awards named Swift as the Artist of the Decade, and she performed a medley of some of her biggest hits at the ceremony. That night, she also beat Michael Jackson’s record to become the artist with the most AMA wins in history, earning her 29th award. The next month, Billboard named Swift their Woman of the Decade.  In January 2020, Swift released Miss Americana, a documentary directed by Lana Wilson that offered fans an unprecedented glimpse into Swift’s everyday life and decision to speak up about politics, alongside “Only The Young”, a political track she wrote while recording Lover.  In July 2020, Swift released her eighth studio album, folklore, after announcing it the day before, making it her first “surprise” release. While most of her work is autobiographical, she notably focused on telling other people’s stories throughout the record. She went on to release The Long Pond Studio Sessions on the streaming service, Disney+, where she performed folklore live for the first time. folklore won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in February 2021, making Swift the first woman and fourth artist overall to win Album of the Year three times.  Swift released the follow-up project evermore in December 2020, expanding the stories she told on folklore as well as becoming her second surprise release. It featured collaborations with Bon Iver, who also appeared on folklore, her long-time friends in HAIM, and The National, whose member Aaron Dessner was a key collaborator and producer throughout both folklore and evermore.   Swift shifted her focus to her back-catalog in 2021, vowing to rerecord her first six albums to regain legal ownership.

Billie Eilish,"Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O Connell (b. December 18, 2001), known professionally as Billie Eilish, is an American singer and songwriter born and raised in Los Angeles, California.  Working alongside her older brother Finneas, her co-writer and producer, she’s taken the internet by storm with her haunting vocals and eerily beautiful lyrics and production that was poised to breakout.  For Billie, creating music wasn’t always her niche—dancing was. Born and raised in the entertainment mecca of Los Angeles, from a family comprised of musicians and actors, Billie was enthralled in the spotlight of dance. However, amid a growth plate injury in 2015, occurring in practice for a recital she was dancing eleven hours a week for, she became an underground pop sensation.  Singing and songwriting had never been unknown to Billie, having written her first song at four and joined the Los Angeles Children’s Choir at eight. So when her dance instructor was looking for a song to choreograph, Billie, with help from Finneas, created “ocean eyes.” The two also agreed to upload it to SoundCloud, where it went viral with over two million streams, landing her a record deal with Interscope.  From there, several remixes spawned and a follow-up single “Six Feet Under” was released the following year.  In 2017, she released her debut EP, dont smile at me, which received mainstream applause and landed her a spot on Apple Music’s showcase for upcoming artists, UpNext. The EP also hit the top 40 on the Billboard 200 on July 19th.  On March 29th, 2019, Billie Eilish released her highly anticipated debut album, WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? — a record centered around Eilish’s fascination with dreams and nightmares. Two weeks before its release, the album was officially given the title of “most pre-saved album of all time on Apple Music,” with over 800,000 to its name.",https://images.genius.com/09e181bc5272d6a196d6d38b93c37400.1000x1000x1.jpg,6592

Cole, David Bowie, 2Pac, Kendrick Lamar, Bob Dylan, 50 Cent and A$AP Rocky as huge influences on her music, but also on the way she writes and sings.  I love Pink and Nelly Furtado – the honesty and truth in their lyrics. I also love Kendrick Lamar and Chance the Rapper. I wanted to try to put those two influences together in my music: descriptive, dark lyrics, with the raw elements of hip-hop in the verses, going into a poppy chorus. So it becomes pop with a twist, that element that nobody else has. At least, I’d like to think so.",https://images.genius.com/dd37b530cf20f2ce699f91e02a476a8a.847x847x1.jpg,1405

BTS,"BTS is a South Korean pop (hip-hop influenced) group consisting of RM, Jin, SUGA, j-hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook. The group’s name is an acronym for ‘Bangtan Sonyeondan (방탄소년단)’ which translates into ‘Bulletproof Boy Scouts.’ They also use ‘Beyond the Scene’ as the English meaning of the acronym.  BTS are heavily involved in their music production, 90 percent of their lyrics are penned by the members and some of them also act as producers.  The group combines various genres of music, ranging from pop sounds like on “I Need U,” hip-hop (“욱 (UGH!)”) or  moombahton (“피 땀 눈물 (Blood Sweat & Tears)”), to British rock in “봄날 (Spring Day).” Lyrically, they lean heavily on the struggles and excitement of youth, but they also criticize social issues through songs like “뱁새 (Silver Spoon)” and “Am I Wrong,” causing them to be perceived as one of the more socially conscious k-pop artists.  The combination of their musical storytelling and aesthetic, powerful and heavily choreographed stage performances, and sneak peeks into their daily life through social media has earned them a loyal fanbase called ARMY.  The septet debuted on June 13, 2013 with “No More Dream,” of their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, which encourages their listeners to achieve their dreams. Throughout their various mini albums and a first studio album, Dark & Wild, BTS continued to display a rebellious concept with the addition of a newfound romance. The studio album also marked the end of the ‘school era.’  In 2015, they wholly evolved through ‘HYYH (The Most Beautiful Moment In Life) era,’ releasing three mini albums and defining themselves through referencing youth-related struggles and mental health in their lyrics.  In 2016 they released their second studio album, Wings. The album thematically deals with temptation and growth and is heavily inspired by the Hermann Hesse’s novel, Demian.  In 2017 the group revealed a new brand identity—the new logo and they extended their name with ‘Beyond the Scene’ as the additional acronym for BTS. The group also began their ‘Love Yourself’ era, with two mini albums and their third studio album, Love Yourself: Tear. Following this, BTS became the first-ever K-pop group to win the Billboard Music Award. They went on to win this award for the second time in 2018, overtaking other international superstars, and they debuted their song, “FAKE LOVE” on television at the BBMAs, another feat never seen before in the K-pop industry.  Also in 2017, as the first Korean artist, BTS joined the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to stage campaigns against violence toward children and teens around the world. One year later, BTS made history being the first K-pop group to speak at the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and were awarded the fifth-class Hwagwan Order of Cultural Merit by the President of South Korea for the contribution to Korean culture.  In 2019 with a mini album they’ve started ‘Map of the Soul’ era. They made history by becoming the first K-pop act to perform at Saturday Night Live, debuting their song “Boy With Luv,” gaining another achievement in the K-pop scene. Following this, they were nominated for and earned two Billboard Music Awards, in the category of Top Social Artist and Top Duo/Group, becoming the first K-pop group to achieve the latter.  In 2020, they released their fourth studio album Map of The Soul: 7. In September 2020, BTS became the first Korean act to hit #1 on Billboard Hot 100 with their first English language song as a lead artist, “Dynamite.” The song broke numerous worldwide records, including three Guinness World Records (BTS holds over ten of them). The group held #1 simultaneously on seven Billboard charts. Just few weeks later, BTS scored #1 on Billboard Hot 100 with the second song—“Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat) [BTS Remix].”  Their fifth Korean studio album, BE, was released on November 20, 2020 with the lead single “Life Goes On.” The single debuted at # 1 on Billboard Hot 100, the first predominantly non-English-language song to do so.

Meg grew up the daughter of rapper Holly-Wood (Holly Thomas), and listened to Southern rap staples like Three 6 Mafia and UGK from an early age. By 14 years old, this had largely inspired her to start writing her own raps, and she then went on to establish her presence around the Houston rap circuit by battling and beating opponents in local freestyle competitions.

Unfortunately, two months on, Megan sustained gunshot wounds and had to undergo surgery to remove bullet fragments from her feet. She later alleged it was musician and acquaintance Tory Lanez that fired the gun—causing a messy, high-profile public controversy to transpire.

Ariana Grande,"Ariana Grande (born Grande-Butera on June 26, 1993) is an actress and a pop vocalist from Boca-Raton, Florida. She had performed in many plays as a child but didn’t make a significant dent in her dream to become an R&B star until being cast as a cheerleader in the Broadway musical 13, earning a National Youth Theatre Association Award for her performance.  Soon after, she was able to land a role in the Nickelodeon hit TV series, Victorious, which propelled her to become a teen idol as her on-screen character seemed to be “very impressionable and easily swayed” but “generally sweet.”  From this point on, she was able to garner the fan base that allowed her to create tracks that worked only towards the promotion of the show, like “Put Your Hearts Up.”  She would have to wait until August 2012 to see the cancellation of Victorious, which allowed Grande to finally make music her priority. With her life now revolving entirely around this passion, she was able to release her debut album, Yours Truly: the result of a three-year endeavor. She completed the album, initially titled Daydreamin, in June 2013; it was released on August 19, 2013. In September 2013, it debuted at No. 1 on the US Billboard 200 albums chart, with 138,000 copies sold in its first week, making Grande the first female artist since Ke$ha to have her first album debut atop the charts.  On August 25, 2014, Ariana Grande released her second studio album, My Everything. Selling 166,000 copies in its first week, My Everything also debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 chart. “The Honeymoon Tour” kicked off in February of 2015, and further promoted the album.  On October 30, 2015, Ariana released “Focus.” The song was initially intended to be the lead single for Grande’s 3rd album; however, it was removed in favor for the album’s title track. The song made an appearance on the Japanese release of the album. On May 20, 2016, Grande released Dangerous Woman, which became her first album to not debut at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 200 chart, rather debuting at No. 2, selling 129,000 copies in the first week.  On February 3, 2017, Ariana started her second tour, the “Dangerous Woman Tour,” to promote the album. On May 22, 2017, during the Manchester Arena show, Grande’s performance was interrupted by a terrorist bombing. The tragedy killed 22 people and injured almost 800 people, and in June of the same year, Grande organized a benefit concert One Love Manchester to support the victims and their families.  Over two years later, Grande released her fourth studio album, Sweetener, on August 17, 2018. The album became her third No. 1 album and is her most acclaimed album to date. Sweetener gave Ari her first GRAMMY award for “Best Pop Vocal Album.”  On February 8, 2019, only six months after releasing Sweetener, Ariana released her fifth studio album, thank u, next, which included the Billboard No. 1 hits “7 Rings” and “thank u, next”, and the top five hit, “break up with your girlfriend, i’m bored.” The album contained themes surrounding female empowerment, denial, self-doubt, trauma, failed relationships, and a little bit of braggadocio.  Later that same year, Grande announced her role as co-executive producer for the Charlie’s Angels Official Soundtrack, released on November 1, 2019, featuring collaborations from Miley Cyrus, Lana Del Rey, Chaka Khan and more.  On the last day of her Sweetener World Tour, December 22, 2019, Grande released her sixth album titled k bye for now. The release marks her first live album, containing live versions of the original tracks from Sweetener.  In May 2020, she released “Stuck with U,” her second official collaboration with Justin Bieber. The song reached No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100 chart shortly after, becoming Ariana’s third No. 1 single in the US and Justin’s sixth. Later the same month, she was featured on “Rain on Me,” with Lady Gaga, which would go on to be the most nominated song of the 2020 MTV VMAS with seven nominations.  On October 23, 2020, she released the title single from her sixth studio album, positions, which was released on October 30, 2020. Collaborators on the album included Doja Cat, The Weeknd, and Ty Dolla $ign.",https://images.genius.com/d36a47955ac0ddb12748c5e7c2bd4b4b.640x640x1.jpg,5975
Eminem,"A legendary hip-hop icon who started as an underground battle rapper in Detroit, Marshall “Eminem” Bruce Mathers III (1972 – present) has developed a career full of controversy, wild swings, and some of the most noteworthy raps in the history of the genre.  Eminem has broken countless barriers, shifting and impacting the culture in several ways. In June 2017, “Stan” was added into the Oxford Dictionary, and in 2019, to the Merriam-Webster dictionary. He was the first rapper to win the Grammy Award for Best Album for three consecutive albums. “Rap God” set the Guinness World Record for most words in a song. He was also the first rapper to win an Oscar. His albums The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show became certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2011, making him one of the few artists to have more than one Diamond album. This has helped him become the highest selling hip-hop artist of all time. In January 2020, with his 11th studio album Music to Be Murdered By debuting at #1 on the Billboard 200, Eminem became the first artist in history to have 10 consecutive #1 debuts.  Produced and co-signed by Dr. Dre, Em had an unprecedented run of success from 1999 up until 2003, releasing three well-reviewed multi-platinum albums, stealing the show on countless collaborations, and even starred in a hit movie. However, it all came crashing down around 2004, when a string of problems ranging from drug dependence to depression to the tragic death of best friend Deshaun “Proof” Holton in 2006 led to a long hiatus from music and a pair of what were, by his own admission, sub-par albums.  This led to Em switching his style up from his previously shock-oriented lyrics to more emotional subject matters on the 2010s Recovery. This was a well-received and Grammy-award winning album, and he employed a very similar approach to 2013’s The Marshall Mathers LP 2, the well-received sequel to Em’s magnum opus.  Eminem invested himself farther than ever into this new emotional style with 2017’s  Revival, which included lyrics about his place in hip-hop, as well as modern issues including President Donald Trump. Despite the serious direction, many were turned off to the album due to its heavy Rock-sampling, with many considering it one of, if not his weakest project.  Following the controversy surrounding Revival and criticism of his modern-style, Eminem surprise-released  Kamikaze on 31 August 2018, which responded to critics of Revival and his career overall. The album was received much better than his previous and went on to be the highest selling rap album of 2018.  Once again by surprise, Eminem released Music to Be Murdered By on 17 January 2020, being Eminem’s first full-length project for the new decade. The album, similar to 2018’s Kamikaze, includes fast-paced rapping and heavy rhyming. The album’s cover is a reference to Sir Alfred Hitchcock, and his 1958 debut album Music to Be Murdered By. In December 2020, Em released Music to Be Murdered By: Side B. This deluxe edition includes 16 new tracks that were not on the original tracklist.  He has an extensive list of hit singles; some of the most popular include “Without Me,” “Lose Yourself,” “Stan,” “The Real Slim Shady,” “Mockingbird,” “When I’m Gone,” “Love the Way You Lie,” “Not Afraid,” “The Monster,” “Rap God” and “River.”  Em is one half of Bad Meets Evil with Royce Da 5 9"", and was a part of D12 with Mr. Porter, Kuniva, Swifty McVay, and Bizarre, and formerly with Proof, Bugz & Fuzz Scoota.  Eminem founded Shady Records in 1999 after the success of The Slim Shady LP and served as the label’s president along with his manager, Paul Rosenberg.    As of February 8, 2018, Eminem’s “Lose Yourself” is officially certified diamond in the United States, meaning the song has sold over 10 million copies. It’s Eminem’s third diamond single after “Not Afraid” and “Love the Way You Lie."" Eminem is now the first rapper and only the second artist to ever achieve this accolade.",https://images.genius.com/c674178296f3d65792a66f851fbc62fc.900x900x1.png,25164
Maroon 5,"Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band. They were originally formed in 1994 as Kara’s Flowers while they were still attending high school. They signed to Reprise Records and released an album, The Fourth World, in 1997. After a mediocre response to the album, the band parted with their record label and attended college, but in 2001, the band regrouped, added James Valentine to the lineup, and pursued a new direction under the name Maroon 5.  Their first big hit came in the form of “Harder to Breathe,” the edgier lead single from their debut, Songs About Jane. The continued success of that song and other singles “This Love,” “She Will Be Loved,” and “Sunday Morning” cemented the quintet as a pop-rock band to keep an eye out for.  However, for their second album, It Won’t Be Soon Before Long, they switched to ambing up on slick pop production—and it worked for them. Lead single “Makes Me Wonder” jumped 63 places in one week to reach number one, becoming their first ever #1 single.  With the releases of Hands All Over, Overexposed, and V, the group has been slowly growing poppier yet keeping their appeal. In fact, after the #14 peak of their 2010 single “Misery,” they hit the top ten with every single one of their singles until 2015’s “This Summer’s Gonna Hurt.”  Their tried-and-true formula of songs that blur the line between love and hooking up has kept all of their fans from the early 2000s and made new ones far into the 2010s.",https://images.genius.com/6780ce1add3af75c73929a8f6630e099.900x900x1.jpg,682
Young Thug,"Jeffery Lamar Williams (b. August 16, 1991), popularly known as Young Thug, is an innovative trap artist from Atlanta known for his experimental vocal styles on versatile production ranging from hard trap beats to experimental pop records. Thug is known as a pioneer for much of the 2010s generation of rap, and his constant cosigns, features, and chart presence cement his status as a leader in the streaming era and current rap scene.  While Young Thug released his first mixtape in 2011, it wasn’t until fellow ATL trap artist Gucci Mane took Thug under his wing in 2013 that he began to see great success as an artist. That year, Thug released his first major hit, “Stoner,” which quickly gained viral traction on social media, then “Danny Glover,” which propelled him to an even larger scale of success. After Gucci Mane went to prison in 2013, Thug saw success by re-aligning himself with Cash Money Records’s own Birdman and his newly-formed Rich Gang collective with the hit single “Lifestyle” and a collaborative mixtape before officially signing to 300 Ent. in 2015. Under 300, Thug continued to release many more singles, mixtapes, and features, gradually boosting his popularity before releasing his debut album, So Much Fun, which topped the Billboard 200 on August 31, 2019.  After 2015’s “Best Friend” became Thug’s first platinum single, his 2016 collaboration with Travis Scott, “pick up the phone,” became his new highest-charting song on the Billboard Hot 100. This would later be succeeded by “Havana” with Camila Cabello, the best-selling single of 2018. However, his current highest-charting song as lead artist is “Hot,” which topped the Rolling Stone 100 and peaked at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100, surpassing his previous biggest hit, “The London,” which peaked at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100.  In 2017, Young Thug officially founded his own label, Young Stoner Life Records, consisting of Lil Duke, Gunna, Lil Keed, and Wheezy, among others. The label also released a compilation album together, 2018’s Slime Language.  Thug has been cited as an inspiration for many popular artists, including Lil Uzi Vert, Gunna, Lil Baby, NBA YoungBoy, and even the legendary Kanye West. While many have dubbed Thug as a huge musical inspiration, Jeffery himself consistently cites Lil Wayne as his biggest idol and influence, even though they have both publicly spoken about their past issues with one another, which have since been resolved.  Young Thug’s frequent collaborators outside of YSL include Gucci Mane, Migos, Travis Scott, Future, and formerly Rich Homie Quan. Thug has also worked extensively with producers such as Wheezy, London On Da Track, Metro Boomin, TM88, and Southside.  Thug has also officially released collaboration projects with Bloody Jay, Rich Homie Quan, Future, and Chris Brown, along with being a major participant in the group projects Lobby Runners and Bankroll Mafia.",https://images.genius.com/e28585c345e4e8a5a2134f1a71296d31.750x750x1.png,2337

Halsey,"Halsey is the stage name of New Jersey singer Ashley Nicolette Frangipane. It is an anagram of her first name and reference to the Halsey Street subway stop and street in Brooklyn where she used to live. The bio on her website reads:  I am Halsey. I will never be anything but honest. I write songs about sex and being sad.""  Halsey was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when she was 17. This has greatly influenced her creative process from the start of her career. Songs like “Control” and “Gasoline” explicitly delve into her psychological and emotional battles. Manic, Halsey’s third album and arguably her rawest and most emotionally vulnerable, was written in a fully manic state rather than a depressive one.  When Halsey was a teen with over 14,000 friends on MySpace, she posted covers of songs on YouTube. In 2012, she recorded “The Haylor Song,” a parody of Taylor Swift’s hit song “I Knew You Were Trouble” that created controversy over the nature of the lyrics. Nevertheless, she had accumulated a respectable amount of online attention, reaching 16,000 subscribers on YouTube at the age of 18.  In 2014, Halsey posted her first single “Ghost” on Soundcloud, which turned heads in her direction. Her close friend Anthony pretended to be her manager, accompanying her in various meetings with different record labels. After being signed to Astralwerks, she released her EP Room 93 in late 2014, with four of the five tracks carrying accompanying music videos, giving the EP a “visual” feel. She was the most mentioned artist online at SXSW 2015, which was evident by her ever-increasing fanbase. She reached over half a million followers on Twitter at the age of 20.  In anticipation of her debut effort, Badlands, “Hold Me Down” was released as a pre-order single, followed by “New Americana,” the anthem of today’s diversified generation. Badlands was officially released on August 28, 2015, described by Halsey as “an angry female record”. It also represents her mental state. At Firefly Music Festival 2015, she told an interviewer, “For me, it was about creating a universe and making it so that people felt like they were actually being transported somewhere.”  Halsey and Justin Bieber got together on the Skrillex-produced track “The Feeling,” which they performed together on the TODAY Show in promotion for Bieber’s fourth album Purpose. In 2016, she collaborated The Chainsmokers on the song of the summer, “Closer,” which would go onto become her biggest hit. The Grammy-nominated earworm maintained its reign at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 consecutive weeks. Halsey later dropped “Not Afraid Anymore” for the soundtrack of the 2017 film Fifty Shades Darker.  Halsey’s sophomore album hopeless fountain kingdom was released June 2, 2017. The record’s title fulfills the long-debated acronym “HFK” that she continuously hinted at through the years. The album is inspired by the story of Romeo and Juliet. That same year, Halsey and her then-boyfriend G-Eazy released “Him & I.”  Halsey’s first track of 2018 was a feature on Thirty Seconds to Mars  “Love Is Madness.” The collabo track “Eastside” saw her teaming up with Khalid and benny blanco. Soon after Halsey dropped “Without Me,” the first single from her then-unannounced 2020 album, she and G-Eazy ended their on-again-off-again relationship, leading fans to speculate and later confirm that “Without Me” was about their very public relationship. “Without Me” hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and in honor of its charting success, she dropped a remix with the now-deceased rapper Juice WRLD.  Halsey’s 2019 began with a collaboration with English rocker YUNGBLUD titled “11 Minutes,” Soon after, the pair confirmed they were dating The duo went on to record a cover of Death Cab for Cutie’s “I Will Follow You into the Dark” for triple J.  After years of friendship, Korean-pop group BTS featured Halsey in “Boy With Luv,” which broke YouTube’s record for most views on a music video in 24 hours, with 78 million views. As of October 2020, the video now has over 990 million views.  On May 17, 2019, Halsey released the stand-alone single, “Nightmare,” initially intended to be the first single of her third album Manic. Following this, “Graveyard” was released, with Halsey announcing that Manic would drop in January 2020. Singles “Finally // beautiful stranger,” “SUGA’s Interlude,” and “You should be sad” dropped in anticipation for the album.  Manic is Halsey’s first album that does not “hide behind a concept""—it’s fully raw nature brings forward her most vulnerable self. She told Rolling Stone that mania is ""that thing in the back of our minds that drives us to outrageous thoughts. Like when you’re driving a car and you’re like [she mimes suddenly cutting over the wheel], or you’re on top of a building, and you’re like, ‘What if I just jump?’ … You are controlled by those impulses rather than logic and reason.”",https://images.genius.com/3e573241985d8a92a9b3ae9a2f144d68.399x399x1.jpg,2520

Born on the north side of Chicago in the Cabrini-Green district, G experienced the grisly and unforgiving realities of the street life within Illinois  largest city. Growing up on the block, experiencing the deaths of friends and loved ones, and facing jail time became the staples of Capalot’s childhood, which he in turn implemented into his music as a means to escape what he witnessed and was raised on.  The rap genre became an outlet for the Windy City teen to cope with the violent loss of several family members and friends. In 2017, he started releasing tracks on SoundCloud and YouTube via WorldStarHipHop, which slowly gained him a following.  Although records like April 2018’s “Neva Cared (Remix)” and July 2018’s “Gang With Me” gained Polo traction in Chicago, Polo started truly bubbling into the mainstream with the release of “Finer Things” in August 2018, a song he wrote while incarcerated.

One of the songs, “Little Lady” (feat. Mikill Pane), was a fan favourite, so Ed made a more radio-friendly solo version entitled “The A Team” and the rest is history. The song now has over a million sales in the UK and two million in the US.  Picked up by Asylum/Atlantic Records, Sheeran released another single entitled “You Need Me, I Don’t Need You.” He released his debut album + in September 2011, to great critical acclaim.

Queen,"Formed in 1970, Queen was a British rock band whose classic line-up consisted of Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and piano, Brian May on lead guitar, Roger Taylor on drums, and John Deacon on bass. Although Mercury and May wrote the bulk of the band’s material, all four contributed to the songwriting, churning out huge hits. Initially a progressive rock band with strong metal influences, their sound evolved dramatically over time. The band went on to refine, if not define “stadium rock,” as they grew to become one of the most beloved rock bands of all time.  Their early progressive phase spawned epic tracks like “March of the Black Queen” and one international hit single: “Killer Queen.” But it was their 1975 track “Bohemian Rhapsody” which catapulted the group to super-stardom. The song reigned at #1  on the UK charts for nine weeks and has since been praised as one of the greatest songs of all time  Moving away from their album-orientated sound, the band only grew in popularity with such songs as November 1976’s “Somebody to Love,” October 1977’s “We Are the Champions,” January 1979’s “Don’t Stop Me Now,” June 1980’s “Another One Bites the Dust,” January 1984’s “Radio Ga Ga,” and many more. These songs are so beloved that a musical based on the band’s discography, titled We Will Rock You, became one of West-End’s longest-running shows with a 12-year run through May 2014—and more events being featured internationally, as well.  In November 2018, Queen’s popularity rose with the Oscar-winning biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody.  The movie’s climax, Queen’s “Live Aid” charity performance, had already gone down in history as one of the greatest live concerts in music history. At the time, in mid-1985, the show was pivotal to Queen’s legacy on a global scale.  After 1985’s Live Aid event, Queen released their 12th studio album, 1986’s A Kind of Magic, and embarked on their final stadium run: The Magic Tour. In 1995, Queen released their 15th studio album, Made in Heaven, culled from vocals recorded before Freddie Mercury’s death in November 1991, due to complications related to AIDS. This occurred just nine months after the February release of Queen’s 14th studio album, Innuendo, which was heralded as their best effort in years.  Deacon retired from music in 1997, after he, May, and Taylor recorded the  Freddie Mercury tribute song “No-One But You (Only the Good Die Young)”; May and Taylor would continue to tour as Queen, with stand-in lead vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert.",https://images.genius.com/30a049d2de687550227ba815650eb196.585x585x1.png,1287

Fleetwood Mac,"Formed from the ashes of John Mayall’s Bluesbreaker, legendary blues guitarist Peter Green, drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John (Mac) McVie formed Fleetwood Mac and had several songs reach the top two spots of the UK Chart in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The band went through nine lineup changes, including Green’s exit, before the addition of Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, a move that elevated the band to international stardom with their self-titled 1975 album, which scored three top 20 US hits, and its follow-up Rumours, one of the best-selling albums of all time, spawning four top 10 hits in the US and four top 40s in the UK.  The band released three more albums over the next ten years that reached the top 10 in several countries around the world, racking up 9 more US top 20s and 5 more UK top 10s, but relations between members were in a continuous state of turmoil with breakups, marriages, divorces, affairs and overindulgence in alcohol and drugs. A prime example can be found in the 1982 video shoot for “Hold Me , with the producer calling it “a fucking nightmare” and its director adding, “Four of them—I can’t recall which four—couldn’t be together in the same room for very long … John McVie was drunk and tried to punch me. Stevie Nicks didn’t want to walk on the sand with her platforms. Christine McVie was fed up with all of them. Mick thought she was being a bitch, he wouldn’t talk to her.”  Nicks, Buckingham and Christine McVie had each also launched successful solo careers during their membership in the band, but after the band’s internationally successful 1987 album Tango In The Night spawned four US top 20 hits, Buckingham officially left that year. Fleetwood Mac struggled to remain relevant with 1990’s Behind The Mask finding moderate success and 1995’s Time going largely unnoticed.  In 1997, the classic lineup of Fleetwood / McVie / McVie / Nicks / Buckingham reunited to record the live album The Dance, which led to international success, three Grammy nominations, a 44-date North American tour and a 1998 induction into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. A 2003 album without Christine McVie found success at first, but cooled quickly and ultimately never found success like the band attained in their peak 1975-1987 era. The band has continued to see its members occasionally exit and return since.",https://images.genius.com/c96d9275641318df4605bc8a9285df5a.1000x1000x1.jpg,272

Sam Smith,"Sam Smith was born on 19th May 1992 and grew up in a rural village on the border of Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire, the nearest town being Bishops Stortford. They’re the oldest of three siblings and are said to be close to their younger sisters. Their mother is a successful City of London trader and their father a stay-at-home dad who brought up the children.  Smith showed an early talent for singing, and their parents responded by arranging singing lessons from the age of eight with professional jazz singer and songwriter, Joanna Eden. At the early age of seventeen, they left school to pursue their dream, living in a small one-bed flat and working in a London pub, but ended up isolated and beset by loneliness.  Sam knew they were gay, they said, for as long as they could remember. They suffered bullying at school and were shocked to find that even in London—close to gay communities—they were subjected to homophobic attacks. These negative experiences, combined with an inherently emotional nature, inform their songwriting and delivery. The soulful, beautifully rich tone of their voice and the subject of the lyrics ‘speak’ to many people and have led to their success.   It was through collaboration with Disclosure’s “Latch” and Naughty Boy’s “La La La”, Smith found themselves more and more in-demand throughout 2012 and 2013. They publicly came out as gay shortly before releasing their debut album In the Lonely Hour on 26 May 2014, which they wrote because they were in love with a man who “didn’t love [them] back”.  In 2015 Sam won the Grammys for Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album. Their popular single “Stay With Me” won the 2015 Grammy for Song of the Year.  In 2017 Sam came out as non-binary stating “I feel as much a woman as I am a man”, and in 2019 announced on Instagram that they were changing their pronouns to the gender neutral they/them.  In September 2017 Sam’s single ‘Too Good at Goodbyes’, the lead single of their sophomore album, was released. It topped the charts in their home country and reached the top five in the U.S. It has accumulated over a billion views on the streaming service, YouTube. In early November, their album ‘The Thrill Of It All’ managed to top the official charts of eleven countries.  On March 20, 2018, Sam began their “The Thrill of It All World Tour” in Sheffield, England. It visited Europe, North America, Asia, New Zealand and Australia. The South Africa leg of the tour began in Cape Town, but was cut short by voice strain and Sam’s fear that they would damage their voice further if the tour continued.  On 27 March 2018, they released “Pray” featuring American rapper Logic. On 17 August 2018, the singer collaborated as the main vocalist on Calvin Harris’s new track “Promises”. The song became Smith’s seventh number one hit on the UK Singles Chart.  In January 2019, Sam Smith released the R&B-tinged, somewhat autobiographical ‘ Dancing with a Stranger"", a timely collaboration with Fifth Harmony’s starlet Normani – a girl group that Sam has been a huge fan of.  In July 2019 “How Do You Sleep"" was released, accompanied by a music video that garnered a hundred million views in less than two months. Sam has said in an interview with Kiss Radio that the story behind the song is broadly autobiographical.  In October 2019 Sam received the Person of the Year award from Attitude Magazine for their campaigning on behalf of the non-binary community.  On 1st November 2019 Sam released a cover, to positive reviews, of I Feel Love, originally released by Donna Summer in 1977.  Sam’s prolific output didn’t end in 2019.

Lana Del Rey,"Lana Del Rey has one of the most enigmatic personalities of modern pop, and it’s won her one of the most devoted audiences of the 2010s. — Billboard  Elizabeth Woolridge Grant (b. June 21, 1985) best known by her stage name Lana Del Rey is an icon of alternative singing and songwriting.       Aged 18, she began performing in clubs around Brooklyn, NY, under various monikers including Lizzy Grant, May Jailer and Sparkle Rope Jump Queen. Around the same time, she began attending Fordham University in The Bronx, where she majored in philosophy, specifically metaphysics.  I was interested in God and how technology could bring us closer to finding out where we came from and why,  she said about her degree. The theme of God and science remains persistent in all of her music, and her high school years at a Christian boarding school.  She signed her first recording contract with 5 Points Records in 2007 and her first digital album Lana Del Ray a.k.a. Lizzy Grant was released in January 2010.  Traces of this era can still be found online but this commercially unsuccessful epoch was ultimately abandoned to make way for the rebrand of Lana Del Rey.  In 2011, a homemade music video for “Video Games” was uploaded to Lana’s YouTube channel. The track became a viral sensation, sparking widespread interest in the artist, and she signed with Interscope/Polydor in the October of that year. On the acknowledgements for her fifth studio album, Lust for Life she wrote  Abel, I still think of the day u posted video games on your Tumblr. Grateful for u.  Here, she references the popular pop singer, The Weeknd Their friendship eventually blossomed into a collaboration on the title track for said album as well as “Stargirl Interlude” on The Weeknd’s album Starboy. She has since delivered a flair unlike any other artist of her generation, praised for its cinematic sound and references to various aspects of pop culture, particularly that of the 1950s and 1960s Americana.  After many studio releases that were removed for a rebrand, Lana explained the meaning of her stage name and how it was influenced by her time in Florida while in college.  I wanted a name I could shape the music towards. I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba – Lana Del Rey reminded us of the glamour of the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue.  Before using Del Rey, she initially chose the alternate spelling Lana Del Ray and released an album under that name, but ultimately chose the latter moving forward.  On January 27, 2012, Lana’s first major-label project, Born to Die, was released. Despite mixed reviews from critics, it is the second-longest charting album on the Billboard 200 by a female artist, and gave Lana her best-known smash hit “Summertime Sadness”.  Later that year the Grammy-nominated EP Paradise was released, and was packaged alongside the reissue of Born to Die.  Two years later, the atmospheric album Ultraviolence was released, showcasing a slightly darker sound and theme. The term comes from the Anthony Burgess novel A Clockwork Orange and refers to excessive or unjustified violence.  2015 saw the arrival of Honeymoon which Del Rey described as being “a tribute to Los Angeles”. The album became the subject of much critical acclaim, garnering the most praise of all of her projects before it, with some even calling it her best work yet.  Her fifth studio album Lust For Life followed in 2017, packing some high-profile features with artists including The Weeknd, A$AP Rocky, Playboi Carti and Stevie Nicks. Billboard called it a “new-age folk” record and it was named in the Top 50 Best Album of the Year lists by several high-profile music publications.  After much anticipation, teasing and at least one deferred release date, on August 30, 2019, Norman Fucking Rockwell! was debuted to the world. This album earned her Grammy nominations and places on year-end lists, launching her further than ever into the limelight.  Only days after NFR!’s release, in an interview with The Times, Lana confirmed that a new project entitled Chemtrails Over the Country Club (previously known as White Hot Forever) was in the works with a potential release in 2020. Nearing the end of 2019, Lana also announced she would be releasing a spoken word album on 4th January 2020, as her poetry book was taking long to hand-bind.  Similar to the way Chemtrails Over The Country Club was announced, Lana took to Instagram  after the release of Chemtrails to announce a follow-up LP called Rock Candy Sweet that is expected to be released on June 1st, 2021.       A visual artist as well as performer, Del Rey has released a number of music videos, including a short music film that she wrote, directed and starred in, titled Tropico. The piece features dark undertones and haunting scenes of vintage technicolor.  Lana’s lyrics explore a broad range of intricate topics such as love and relationships, famous icons and her idols, her own experiences with fame, pop culture, religion, patriotism and nostalgia. She uniquely encapsulates a mix of magic, glamour and beauty, intertwined with grit, destruction and sadness. Vogue UK published an interview with Lana in late 2011 where it was revealed that she refers to her musical artistry as “Hollywood sadcore”.  Lana’s catalog of work is not made up of a constant stream of mainstream radio hits, and she continues to remain singular in her style of writing and singing, showing no similarity to any artist in modern pop or alternative music.",https://images.genius.com/a972d0604ec2eec1005fe1747a859bb4.1000x1000x1.jpg,3731

Imagine Dragons,"One of the defining artists of the 2010s and perhaps the biggest band of the decade, Imagine Dragons is an American alt-rock band that originated in Las Vegas and led by Dan Reynolds. While the band began in 2008, the group boasted an entirely different roster than most are familiar. Before releasing their debut album, Night Visions, in 2012, the band released six EPs over four years, constantly shifting their sound and roster from folk to the crowd-shattering anthems they’ve been known for since.  The band’s roster was finalized before Night Visions‘ release with Daniel Platzman on the drums, Wayne Sermon on guitar, and Ben McKee on bass. Their break-out single, “Radioactive” was essential to putting Vegas on the map musically, citing The Killers before them. The song went on to become an international success, obliterating the record for the most weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 at 87 straight weeks.  It wasn’t until 2015 the band released their sophomore album, Smoke + Mirrors. The album was extremely divergent from their freshman album, characterized by an accentuation of their Rock roots and an internal struggle, later described by Reynolds as being his bout with severe depression.  After a self-imposed hiatus in 2016, the band premiered their third album, Evolve, during Super Bowl LI. As the title suggests, Evolve was seen as another evolution of the band’s sound, with a newfound focus around Pop and EDM.
