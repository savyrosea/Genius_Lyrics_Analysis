Along the way, he references real events in rock history, name-drops Bon Scott and Jim Morrison, and highlights rockstar traditions like throwing TVs out of hotel windows.  Post previewed the song in December 2016, nine months before he released it, by posting a video of himself jamming to it in the studio. The preview received thousands of retweets on Twitter over the course of the year, so the track was highly anticipated by the time it finally dropped.  In late December of 2017, it was also revealed that Joey Bada$$ had co-written the track as well as penning an extra verse after Music Mafia leaked the original version of the song. This version also contained a verse from T-Pain, which he confirmed, in place of the 21 Savage’s contributions that ultimately appeared on the final version of the song.  On January 9, 2018, “rockstar” broke the record for holding the number one spot on Spotify’s Global chart with 108 days spent on the top of the list. The previous record holder was Ed Sheeran’s “Shape Of You.”",18,440,6883347

In an interview with XXL, Malone said the track’s success was unexpected:  When I wrote it, I didn’t know that people [were] gonna fuck with it as much as I did. I didn’t plan on releasing it any time soon either, but it leaked somewhere and we just said ‘fuck it’ and recorded it.  Allen Iverson was heralded as one of the greatest players of his time. In his prime, he was considered one of the best players in the NBA, as reflected by his winning of the Most Valuable Player award in 2001.  Post explained his stage name at the Breakfast Club: Post is his real last name, and he made up the Malone part for practically no reason. However, Post has also said he got the idea for his stage name by entering his real name, Austin Post, into a rap name generator.",31,222,4144447

Recruiting Ty Dolla $ign, the two sing about the luxuries they have earned such as convertibles, Audemars Piguet wristwatches, and other expensive jewelry. Post often raps about jewelry, and has posted on Quora to explain what drives him to do so:  When I was a little kid, I would rap about stuff that I wanted, like, “Hey, I’m working my ass off and I want this stuff in the future.” Because you’re not being braggadocious, but you’re still cool because you know what all this stuff is.  Post initially teased the song on January 4, 2017; over a year before its eventual release. Similar to how “rockstar” was teased, Post can be seen vibing to the song in the studio with a beer and a cigarette in hand. The track’s release date was announced when Post revealed he would tour North America in 2018.  “Psycho” debuted at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, matching “rockstar” for Post Malone’s best debut on the Hot 100. Psycho’s debut at #2 also made Post Malone the ninth artist ever, and the second rapper, to have more than one song debut in the top 2 of the Billboard Hot 100. The song eventually peaked at #1 on June 11, 2018, marking Post’s second chart-topping song of his career and the first for Ty.",21,230,3080338

The song was released as the sixth single from Stoney on October 17, 2017.  He jokingly mentioned in a Hot 97 interview that he “dove into his really emotional side” and even “cut himself to some records” in the album, and it shows in his lyrics.",7,126,2640350

The track continues the heartbreak theme from “Goodbyes” as he struggles to maintain a strong relationship with this girl. Like “Goodbyes,” “Circles” fell victim to leaks before official announcements. A snippet of the track originally surfaced online in July of 2019, with the full song being leaked online later in August.  In 2018, Post released the song “Stay” in a very similar fashion—the song was debuted on April 4, 2018, during his first Bud Light Dive Bar Tour show in Nashville, Tennessee. Like “Stay,” “Circles” features a more unique instrumental compared to the majority of Post’s discography, and is sonically similar to his 2016 track, “Hollywood Dreams / Come Down.”  An official teaser was shared on August 5, 2019, and the full song was later debuted by Post during his Bud Light Dive Bar Tour performance on the same day in New York. During his performance at the Bud Light Dive Bar Tour, Post said that the track would be released the next week, leading many to believe it was supposed to be released on August 16. However, the song was not released on its original expected release date. In an Instagram post on August 28, 2019, Post announced the song would be released on August 30, 2019, alongside the song’s cover art.",4,126,1868597

Abel sets the record straight about what this woman means to him, and reminds her that she plays an equally guilty part in this affair.  On the Hot 100 dated October 3, 2015, “The Hills” reached number one on the chart, dethroning his own “Can’t Feel My Face.” With the feat, Abel became only the 11th artist to replace himself at #1, and the 2nd artist to top the chart with a lead single after the second single was released. (Rihanna did it in 2010 with lead single “Only Girl (In The World)” and second single “What’s My Name,” which featured frequent Weeknd collaborator Drake.) It topped the chart for six weeks, becoming his longest-running #1.  On October 11th, two remixes were released featuring both Eminem and Nicki Minaj respectively.",11,319,8901084

Transforming from mysterious Canadian act to Billboard mainstay. Abel has come a long way, but with negative consequences in his journey to the top, he has developed mixed feelings towards fame.  “Starboy” potentially marks a new era for The Weeknd. On the release date of the song, Abel posted an Instagram picture with the caption “r.i.p ‘@abelxo,’” marking the turn of his character and sound.  The song features production from French electronic duo Daft Punk, marking the first collaboration between The Weeknd and Daft Punk, and the latter’s first single since “Give Life Back To Music” was released in early-2014.

The track finds Abel in a constant state of distraction that he only gets relief from when in the presence of a significant other. The song is an up-tempo electropop track that features large ‘80s-inspired synths and electronic dance music drums, similar to the sonic direction of his third studio album, Starboy.  The track was first announced on November 24, 2019 in the trailer for a Mercedes Benz advertisement. The full commercial debuted minutes after the song’s release and is heavily centered around it. In the ad, The Weeknd drives around in a Mercedes car as the track plays in the background.  The song leaked on November 26, 2019, a few days before its official release. Abel acknowledged in a tweet, where he confirmed its official release:  oh yah… and more new music tonight (in HQ😉)  A music video for the track was released on January 21, 2020. The video is a continuation of the music video from “Heartless,” starting with Abel stopping his manic run through Las Vegas, which is where the video for “Heartless” ended. From there, Abel continues his tear through the city while under the influence of many substances, this time going to a strip club as well as driving a different luxury Mercedes Benz AMG-GT in the video.",9,181,2093534

Say so","Despite not being released as an official single until the song was sent to radio months after release, “Say So” gained the most traction from Doja Cat’s sophomore album Hot Pink. This is mainly due to users on the popular video-sharing platform, TikTok, uploading videos of themselves dancing to it. Her August 2018 track “MOOO!” and March 2019’s “Juicy” had also achieved similar success on the platform.  On the upbeat R&B dance-inspired track, Doja sings about wanting her friend to stop “beating ‘round the bush” and confess their love to her. Because of a slight mix-up in the chorus of the song during its transcription on Genius, a small frenzy started on Twitter, with many fans thinking that Doja was singing “I get you hot and moaning.” This was later then cleared up by Doja after she tweeted the official lyrics on December 27, 2019, more than 7 weeks after its release.",1,148,1329273

After the song was introduced to the world with its music video release on YouTube, the song dominated social media with praise and became an instant meme.  At first glance, the video may have appeared bizarre to many, as Doja flaunted her cow costume with cheeseburgers and shakes. Once Doja started to rhyme, it became apparent she had created something unique. Lyrically, Doja’s verses are full of cow-related wordplay and she interpolates lines from some of hip-hop’s greatest joints. The beat is also undeniably catchy with its sultry guitars and melodies on the hook, which was produced by Doja Cat herself.  In an interview with Noisey, Doja explained how this song helped her career:  I feel really lucky that this song has created a platform for my debut because that wasn’t the intention behind the song. [My last] album actually got no support. There was nobody trying to push it. Now Katy Perry is tweeting me, which is cool. Chance is cool too. I know he’s a goofy guy and he appreciates DIY. It’s just cool to have these people supporting because it’s great exposure. I like them as well, which is a boner—I meant to say bonus.  After the success of the “Mooo!” video, Doja Cat decided to release an updated version of the song that could be streamed and purchased.",15,183,964047

The official remix was teased on Twitter by Doja Cat prior to its official release on May 1, 2020. This highly anticipated remix marks the first collaboration between the two artists.  On the remix, Nicki adds a new verse on a fresh new beat not present on the original. She shouts out her fellow peers, emphasizes her status as a legend within hip-hop, and even makes references to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent quarantine. Doja’s original second verse is kept intact, while Nicki provides singing vocals and a few bars for the outro.  Two versions of the remix exist, with the older version having an entirely different first verse by Nicki. Doja addressed this on Twitter, saying the proper current version would replace the older versions after its release.",19,127,933472

Travis and Kendrick detail the unique feelings they have for their love interests—especially when she’s not actually there.  Before performing this song live, Travis says he “wrote this song in my bedroom at one of the darkest times in my life.” This, combined with the lyrics in the chorus—specifically such terms as “goosebumps,” “numb,” and “Heimlich”—have led many fans to believe this song may have an underlying theme of prescription drug withdrawal.  The track’s music video was debuted exclusively on Apple Music before being released worldwide on April 3, 2017.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dst9gZkq1a8  In addition, Travis broke JAY-Z and Kanye West’s record of performing a song the most number of times in a live show (“Niggas in Paris” in France 2012) when he performed “goosebumps” 14 times in a row. Incredibly, he proceeded to break his own record the following week.",18,481,4883157

It serves as the lead single to his third studio album, ASTROWORLD, which was released more than a year after this song. It is produced by Murda Beatz, who has worked with Travis a few times before, most notably on the Texan artist’s September 2016 tracks, “sweet sweet” and “outside.”  The “butterfly effect” is a concept that explains and proves how small causes can have large effects. Travis is also using a double-entendre with “butterfly” wherein, as he refers to the doors on his Lamborghini car; he also describes moving to his new life, how great it is, and how he could never go back to the old one.  On May 15, 2017, Travis released the track on SoundCloud, along with two other songs: “A Man” and “Green & Purple.” However, “BUTTERFLY EFFECT” was the only one out of the three songs that was released as a proper single onto streaming services.

Following this, on May 3, 2019, Travis performed a portion of the song during his headlining set at JMBLYA 2019, and then again a week later, during his set at Rolling Loud Miami.  In late June 2019, Travis performed a large portion of the track, during his Morocco performance and on August 31, 2019, he previewed Lil Baby’s verse during a live show.  On September 30, 2019, Travis revealed the single’s final release date and cover art in an Instagram post. Coincidentally, two days before the scheduled release of “HIGHEST IN THE ROOM” Travis and Kylie reportedly called it quits on their relationship.  The song was officially released on October 4, 2019, along with accompanying visuals. However, the final version did not include the teased Lil Baby feature. It eventually was released on the song’s remix in December of 2019.  The track also became Scott’s second single to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and first to debut in the peak position.",12,238,2269170

Scott and Bieber have previously collaborated on tracks including Travis' September 2015 track “Maria I’m Drunk”“ and Justin’s “No Sense” in November 2015.  “Beibs” (a misspelled abbreviation of Bieber’s last name) refers to cocaine, continuing the longstanding tradition of using the names of white celebrities as euphemisms for the drug. Other examples include Migos‘ hit “Hannah Montana” and Lil Wayne’s “White Girl.“  The song title could also be a reference to Nicki Minaj’s May 2012 track “Beez In The Trap”, and is clearly a nod to Travis' album title, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight.

Travis released ASTROWORLD’s trailer four days before the album’s release, which featured the song playing over cinematic scenes of Travis Scott navigating a post-apocalyptic landscape with outer space elements.  The song title could be a reference to Houston’s iconic ties to astrological exploration, with NASA’s Mission Control Center being located in Travis’s hometown.

Lizzo described the process of making the song with Idolator:  It came from Ricky Reed and I. We have such a great chemistry in the studio and I think we had maybe made one or two songs prior. We were still doing chemistry tests with each other. We were in the studio and he was playing this piano riff and he was like, “How does this make you feel?”. I went through a lot of things in my head but it made me feel was like the hair toss emoji. You know, the pink sweater emoji girl with the hair. So I went from that hair toss, to checking my nails. It was a natural statement that came out my mouth. Ricky was like “feeling good as hell”. We just rolled with that. After that everything just kind of came out so easily. That’s when I think our chemistry was really sealed. I just felt like everything’s going to be okay.",0,52,529509

Featuring the iconic rapper Missy Elliott, the song is about body acceptance and how Lizzo needs a heavy beat to dance since slow songs are not enough for all she has to offer.  In an interview with Exclaim!, Lizzo spoke about her collaboration with Missy Elliott on “Tempo”:  I’m very fortunate to be in a position where I have access to send Missy [Elliott] beats, and I have the privilege of being like, ‘Yo, let’s get Missy on this track.’ I was really hopeful that she would hop and she did, and now it’s become this moment for me. You know, when the song was first going down, it was more like ‘Finally I can talk my shit about being a big girl,’ but when Missy jumped on it, it really did make it a full-circle moment of being seen by her existing when I was younger. Hopefully I can really do the same for young girls today. But really, I was just making bops.",6,53,193637

The song went on to become one of Future’s highest-charting singles ever, peaking at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song is also certified 8X platinum by the RIAA.  https://twitter.com/1future/status/854531549798080512  The song also spawned the #MaskOffChallenge, which participants dance and play instruments to the song. It was a huge factor in the song’s popularity.  The song’s official music video was released on May 4, 2017, and two weeks later, on May 23, 2017, a remix featuring Kendrick Lamar was released.",26,381,5616416

In addition to referencing the term lowlife, this song can be interpreted as a play on the term “high life,” generally understood as a luxurious lifestyle afforded to the rich and famous. As supporters of the “low life,” The Weeknd and Future turn “high life” accommodations into austere ones.  The Weeknd released “Low Life” as a Christmas gift for their fans after some teasing. His “Pass Dat (Remix)” was also included in the mini-release. “Low Life” was later revealed to be included on Future’s album EVOL.  https://twitter.com/theweeknd/status/680256090219646976",29,246,2348465

She also references her most public romantic relationships over the years and does not shy away from name-dropping in the process.  The song was released on November 3, 2018, minutes before an episode of Saturday Night Live aired. In a promotional clip, cast member and Ariana’s ex-fiancé, Pete Davidson, made a joke about the two’s failed engagement. Once she was made aware of the clip, she expressed her disgust in a since deleted tweet, writing:  for somebody who claims to hate relevancy u sure love clinging to it huh  She then followed her post with another, tweeting the phrase that would become her new mantra in 2018:  thank u, next  “thank u, next” debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Ariana’s eleventh top-ten entry and her highest charting single to date, surpassing her Iggy Azalea assisted single “Problem,” which peaked at #2 in 2014. Additionally, it was the first song by a lead female artist to debut atop the US charts since Adele’s “Hello” in 2015.  The music video for “thank u, next” was released on November 30, 2018, and is directed by frequent collaborator Hannah Lux Davis, who has previously worked with Ariana on videos for “breathin,” “Side to Side,” and more. The video interpolates iconic early-2000s movies Mean Girls, Bring It On, Legally Blonde, and 13 Going on 30, and features cameo appearances from celebrities including Kris Jenner, Troye Sivan, as well as Ariana’s former Victorious co-stars Daniella Monet, Elizabeth Gillies and Matt Bennett, among others. The music video became a huge success, accumulating more than 55.4 million views in its first 24 hours, becoming the biggest-ever global debut for a music video on YouTube. It would go on to break another YouTube record for the fastest video to reach 100 million views.",8,379,8922035

Think not Why be a king when you can be a god?","“Rap God” is Eminem’s braggadocious ode to himself and his career. Over its six-minute run-time, he references comic books, throws back to his old songs, and raps crazily fast.  In a Q&A with MSN Music Em was asked whether he felt like a Rap God or an underdog, to which he responded with:  I think everything switches back and forth from hour to hour, day by day with me. That whole ‘Rap God’ record pretty much from top to bottom is tongue in cheek. So I mean, do I want to feel like that? Maybe sometimes. Again, it goes back to everybody who competitive raps and does this for just purely the sport of it wants to be the best. Again, that’s why Kendrick’s verse worked so well because he only said what every rapper’s already thinking, If you don’t want to be the best, then why are you rapping?  This song landed Eminem a spot in The Guinness Book of World Records: Most words in a hit single:  The single ‘Rap God’ from Eminem packed a mouth-filling 1,560 words into its 6 min 4 sec runtime.  However, in 2015 Harry Shotta broke Eminem’s world record of most words in a track. Eminem’s “Rap God” has 1560 words, while Harry Shotta’s “Animal” has 1771.",106,1795,17055541

The diss track dropped eleven days after “RAP DEVIL” and was discussed during Eminem’s four-part interview with Sway.  Em began targeting MGK following inappropriate Twitter comments about his daughter Hailie Jade in 2012. According to the second part of the Sway interview, it was MGK’s subliminal disses during Power 106’s May 2017 “L.A. Leakers (Freestyle)” and Tech N9ne’s March 2018 track, “No Reason,” that inspired Eminem to fire back.  Coincidentally, Killshot is the name of a 2008 movie directed by John Madden, and filmed in Eminem’s hometown of Detroit, Michigan. For that reason, fan theories have suggested Eminem must have known about the film. The plot features main character Carmen Colson, who is targeted by an experienced, psychopathic hitman. Colson Baker is Machine Gun Kelly’s government name.",57,1183,6655398

In particular, they become Godzilla, a fictional sea monster that is known for its mass destruction and endless killing.  While this track marks the first collaboration between Juice WRLD and Eminem, Juice had previously listed Em as one of his biggest influences and has frequently referenced his music, perhaps most notably on his May 2018 track, “Lean Wit Me.” On October 25, 2018, Juice joined Tim Westwood TV, where he almost freestyled an hour over different Eminem beats.  This track also serves as Juice WRLD’s first posthumous release since his passing on December 8, 2019—six days after his 21st birthday. Juice reportedly recorded the chorus for the track before his untimely death, although he was unable to complete his actual verse for the song in time. Later, on January 17, 2020, a picture surfaced on XXL that depicted Juice WRLD and his friends after he recorded his feature.  On January 17, 2020, Genius broke down the song in an edition of their Song Stories series. In March 2020 interview with Genius, producer d.a. got that dope broke down how the song came together.  On February 5, 2020, the song received a Gold certification by Music Canada making it the first official certification for the single.  The official music video dropped March 9, 2020. Directed by Cole Bennett, one of the biggest names in music video production, and starring Dr. Dre, retired boxer Mike Tyson, Eminem, actress Anna Dahl, and actor George Todd McLachlan, portraying a young Eminem.

It’s considered one of Eminem’s best songs—if not his best song—and is also his biggest hit to date.  Written between breaks on the set of 8 Mile, engineer Steven King claimed all three verses were rapped “in one take""—but Eminem has since shed doubt on that claim. The beat was older than the song though—Em actually recorded a completely different version of the song over the beat. The demo was eventually released in 2014, dubbed “Original Demo Version,” as part of the SHADY XV compilation album—but that version was more like a dance song.  “Lose Yourself” reached #1 in 20 countries – Eminem’s first in the US, holding the top position for 12 weeks, making it become the third-longest chart topper from a movie soundtrack (behind “I Will Always Love You” and “End Of The Road”). It became the first rap song to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song, won two Grammys (Best Male Rap Solo Performance & Best Rap Song), and has since been certified Diamond (10x Multi-Platinum) in the United States.  The song was used in an iconic Apple iPod commercial and an instrumental version was used in a Chrysler Super Bowl ad that featured Em. It was also performed at the 2020 Academy Awards.  The entire rhyme scheme of this song can be found here.",32,596,5428536

Incidentally, it also marks the fourth time Eminem and Rihanna have collaborated.  This dark and emotional track has Eminem considering his Shady alter-ego a monster. The monster could also be the fame which has taken so much from him, or perhaps the true monster is his mind and the demons that plague it.  This hook was co-written by Bebe Rexha and Jon Bellion, and went on to win the award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 2015 Grammys.",39,539,4616594

Their verses are polar opposites, a thematic structure often employed by Joyner in his songs to show opposing perspectives of the same topic (see “Ross Capicchioni” and “I’m Not Racist”).  Here, Joyner comments on how he hasn’t received any awards, although he is steadily gaining recognition. For instance, the video for his song “I’m Not Racist” went viral in 2017.  Em’s verse, on the other hand, is about how he’s at the top in terms of awards and status but is being overlooked in the current rap scene. This is a recurring theme throughout this album as well as other 2018 releases, such as the remix of “Chloraseptic.”",36,613,4430102

The song also continues themes he explored on 2018’s “Chloraseptic (Remix).” Specifically, Eminem criticizes the double standards of the public towards him in the wake of his 9th album, Revival. Critics are rewarded for pushing negative views about him, but should he retaliate, he falls further in their esteem.  Finally, Em also takes aim at Donald Trump again, pointing out that the President has yet to answer his  2017 BET Hip-Hop Awards Cypher Verse as well as several other missives he sent on Revival.  The title of the song is also a reference to the movie The Ringer. In the film, the protagonist pretends to be mentally disabled in order to enter and win the Special Olympics. Em is basically saying he’s stooping to the level of the mumble rappers to beat them at their own game.",49,803,4003410

The song is the lead single from her highly anticipated third studio album, Rare, and has been seemingly confirmed to be about her rocky relationship with ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber.  A music video was released alongside the song. The music video was shot completely on an iPhone for Apple’s “Shot on iPhone” campaign; these words and the Apple logo can be seen in a promotional video posted by Apple.  The cover art for the track and release date were shared by Selena on Twitter on October 18, 2019. More hype for the release of the song began to build when a credible insider on the music forum ATRL made a cryptic comment “2.2.22.23” on a popular discussion forum about Selena’s music. Many fans immediately pieced together the information and theorized that on either the 22nd or 23rd of October, “Lose You to Love Me” would be released with a music video and another single. As it turned out, Selena released her second single, “Look At Her Now,” the following day.",4,165,2771340

Lyrics for the song were previewed on Selena Gomez’s Instagram leading up to its premiere on Zane Lowe’s World Record feature on Apple Music’s Beats 1 radio station.  The promotion for the song prominently featured polaroid photographs. This was likely directly influenced by 13 Reasons Why—photographs play a large role in the trailer for season two.",3,87,1352574

She first teased the single at the end of the music video for her previous single “Bad Liar,” with about 17 seconds of the “Fetish” video.  Although she was in a relationship with The Weeknd during recording of this track, it is not built around their relationship. Selena commented on this topic during a June 9, 2017 interview on The Zach Sang Show:  I think for me, I like to keep that really separate. … So as much as that has been inspiring … the moment I start doing something because I’m influenced by someone else, it just doesn’t work out.  Selena revealed the official date release and the artwork for the track on Twitter and Instagram.",3,112,1321607

It is a track from Selena’s upcoming album, preceded by its vulnerable and emotional lead single, “Lose You To Love Me,” which was released only a day before. It is also worth noting that the music videos for both songs were collaborations with Apple, and both videos were “Shot on iPhone” for the campaign of the same name.  Rumors about the song started swirling on October 16th, 2019, when a credible ‘insider’ from the music forum ATRL commented “2.2.22.23” on a thread discussing Selena’s music. Fans then pieced together the information and theorized that Selena would release new music on the 22nd and 23rd of October, alongside a music video for each song. Later, he then proceeded to reveal the title of the 2 songs: “Lose You to Love Me” and “Look At Her Now.”  Fans also speculated that the childhood photos Selena had posted were an easter egg for “Look At Her Now”.",2,61,863541

The lead single from Selena Gomez’s second album as a solo artist, Revival, it was a massive international hit, charting in 24 different countries, reaching #1 in Greece and #5 on the Billboard Hot 100.    According to Songfacts, speaking during an On Air with Ryan Seacrest interview, Gomez claimed the song’s lyrical content was deeper than merely being about a woman wanting to look good for her lover:  There’s nothing wrong with a woman being comfortable, confident, [or] whatever it is that you feel. I love that, I love feeling like I’m in love and want to look good for someone. At the same time, there’s no guy in the [music] video, I’m saying I am a diamond, and I like the way that women feel when they’re in that state.  When the first official music video released in June of 2015, many were surprised that it did not contain A$AP Rocky’s feature verse. A second video was released later with ASAP’s vocals included.",11,119,678624

Camila was born in Cojímar, award – or consejo popular – that belongs to the municipality of La Habana Del Este, which is a district of Havana.  Camila immigrated to the US when she was still a kid:   I was almost 7 at the time, born in Havana, Cuba. My papá is puro Mexicano and we lived back and forth between the heat of Havana and the concrete jungle of Mexico City. I didn’t realize it then, but, boy, does it hit me now. I realize how scary it must have been for them.  The song was released as a “Summer Double Feature” along with “OMG” from Camila Cabello’s debut album. The song’s music video was released on October 24. On November 9, a “vertical video” was released for the track.  Camila confirmed it to be a single on August 30. As “Crying in the Club” won’t be included on the album, “Havana” is the lead single of the record. Camila has publicly stated that some people doubted that “Havana” had the potential of being a single, including herself. As of now, it is her favorite song to perform.  There are at least nine versions of the song, including a solo version, a Spanglish version, and a Spanglish remix featuring Daddy Yankee. In an interview with 98.7 AMP, Camila stated that Havana was the hardest song to write of the whole album:  I have performed a version of it in Chicago for a radio show that I had. And, before the song came out, I re-wrote the pre-chorus. That’s how many different times the song had to be worked on.  According to producer Louis Bell, “Havana” is definitely a “Camila song” and it changed the tone of her debut album:  The album started off more serious — dealing with relationship stuff, dealing with a lot of heartbreak, dealing with a lot of life things, with the Fifth Harmony thing. It started off darker, but then towards the end, it lightened up because of where she was in her life. She felt more liberated.  The track eventually reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Thug’s first #1 hit and Cabello’s first solo #1 hit as a lead artist. On April 12, 2018, the song was certified 5x multi-platinum.  On July 3rd, 2018, “Havana” ended it’s 46 week run on the Billboard Hot 100, making it her first solo single to spend the most weeks on the Hot 100.",12,225,3790522

The single was released alongside “Real Friends.”  Camila Cabello teased an unofficial music video via Twitter on December 29, 2017, calling it a “New Year’s Eve gift” for her fans. On February 14, 2018, she announced her first tour as a solo artist, which was named after the song. According to a 2017 Rolling Stone article, it was “inspired by a relationship she had a couple of years back.”  Camila also considers it to be the best track she’s written so far, explaining in a September 2017 Official Charts article that it only took an hour to write. “Never Be The Same” can be seen as the prequel of the relationship that broke Camila in her subsequent January 2018 track, “Consequences”:  …It’s kind of like the aftermath of ‘Never Be the Same.’ I feel like a lot of the songs could be in this one story, and all the different phases, and I feel like ‘Consequences’ is the aftermath of a love that was intoxicating like that, and hard to get out of your mind; or the kind of love that you compare to everybody else and it’s not the same.  –from Coup de Main magazine (February 2018)",4,154,1923558

Ain't no crying in the club","“Crying in the Club” is the Cuban songstress Camila Cabello’s first solo single. The song is a fiery anthem about uplifting yourself after a downfall. The track was initially supposed to be on her debut album, Camila, (previously The Hurting, The Healing, The Loving) but she later revealed that it had been dropped from the final tracklist.  To promote the song, Camila sent fans part of the cover art in order to complete and reveal the artwork. She gave her first live performance of the track at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards, where she also sang “I Have Questions” as a part of Xfinity Encore at the show.  Camila broke down the song ON AIR with Ryan Seacrest, saying:  For me, the club is kind of like a euphemism. The lyrics say stuff like “Let the music lift you up like you’ve never been this free, let the music lift you up like you’ve never been so high.” I feel like for me, that was more of what the writing process and what the album making process was saying to me.  In a 2019 interview to The Telegraph, Camila confessed that she regrets releasing “Crying in the Club”:  I didn’t write and it didn’t feel like me. I had the chorus to “Havana”, but I went with what was safe, what industry people said had worked before. Turns out, no one has a clue.",4,96,790132

Three days later, she revealed that “Real Friends” almost didn’t make it to the album because the song had been finished too close to the deadline. It’s one of the songs she’s had the most fun writing for the album.  “Real Friends” can be seen as a follow-up to her promotional single “I Have Questions”, where she confronts her supposed friends, as this track is Camila’s search for new friendships after leaving her unhealthy friends behind. It’s also one of the two tracks which Camila feels that best represent her in the album.  Camila first performed this song on Lollapalooza Argentina 2018.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9xNGKR2o3E",7,118,728126

I feel like a lot of the songs could be in this one story, and all the different phases, and I feel like “Consequences” is the aftermath of a love that was intoxicating like that and hard to get out of your mind or the kind of the love that you compare to everybody else and it’s not the same.  The track is one of the first songs from the album that Camila worked on, hinted at a year before the song’s release via Twitter. In a livestream, Camila mentioned “Consequences” was one of the songs from her album that she was most excited to share with her fans.  Several months later, Camila released the track as a single, which featured an orchestra. It would mark her final release for the album, leading to a well-deserved break before beginning work on her second album.",4,71,512070

R. Kelly joins in to be the actual lover who she goes to.  Considering the song’s subject matter, the cover art fits, as opposed to being sexual for the sake of marketing.  Due to hitting #1 on iTunes charts all over the world, it was promoted from ARTPOP’s 1st promotional single to the 2nd official single.  Since the song’s release in 2013, R. Kelly’s allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct grew to monumental levels. As a proponent of Gaga proceeded to face criticism as she continued to keep silent on the matter. However, she finally took to Twitter on January 9, 2019, to share a note regarding the situation. She stated her belief in the accusers and support of all victims of sexual assault, denounced R. Kelly and his allegations, and explained how her past experiences and mental capacity at the time led to the song being pushed forward:  The song is called ‘Do What U Want (With My Body)’, I think it’s clear how explicitly twisted my thinking was at the time. If I could go back and have a talk with my younger self I’d tell her to go through the therapy I have since then, so that I could understand the confused post-traumatic state I was in. […] I’m sorry, both for my poor judgment when I was young, and not for speaking out sooner.  She also announced the removal of the song from digital marketplaces and streaming platforms. Two days later on January 11th, the song and remix EP were removed, though the re-release with fellow pop artist Christina Aguilera remains available.  The same day, Christina expressed her support on Twitter:  Being a survivor of past predators myself, these lines spoke to me, which is why I did the song. I embrace all survivors of sexual and domestic violence and abuse holding a special place in my heart, and you @ladygaga, for doing the right thing!",2,118,897759

Noteworthy is this also only the second song ever from Lenny, with a feature on it, with the first one being “Lust” featuring Janelle Kroll.  “Trap” is Lenny and Lil Baby showing how they’re both dealing with their newfound fame and wealth after being raised in a tough environment. The pair share a lot of similarities, with them both being raised by a single mother in poverty, then turning to drug dealing at a young age to earn money. Lenny has been verbal on many occasions, that if it wouldn’t have been for rap, he would most likely still be selling drugs, which he even has a song about, titled “Dope Dealer” released through his rap-collective GØDD COMPLEXx. Same goes for Baby, who never thought that rap was going to be his career.

He loves cactuses”, before singing the hook of Travis Scott’s “90210.” The following day, Travis tweeted the lyrics of this song’s hook, essentially confirming that he was featured on the track. Over the following days, Trippie continuously teased the song on Instagram, saying that he was waiting for Travis to send back his verse.  On November 29, Trippie uploaded another video to Instagram, teasing Travis' part to the song. Trippie originally hinted on the post that he would release the song after the post receives 100,000 comments saying “1400/800”, however, it was deleted later that night. Not long before it was deleted, Travis Tweeted about leaks with several angry emojis, leading some to believe that was the reason why Trippie deleted the video.  The song was released on December 5, 2017, and marks the first collaboration between the two artists.  The title seems to be a reference to the groundbreaking 2008 Christoper Nolan Batman film, “The Dark Knight.” It also seems to make reference to 6ix9ine’s “Gummo,” which is where the ‘Dummo’ from the title comes from. They were recently engaged in beef after they had a fight backstage at ‘Day ‘N Night’ festival.  It’s also worth noting that the melody that Trippie uses in the hook is very reminiscent of the melody he used on XXXTENTACION’s “Fuck Love.”",18,153,852589

The character is unfulfilled by a hedonistic life of consumerism, substance abuse, and adultery. He also has dissatisfaction with the indolence of his peers, feeling no need to heed their advice. With nothing left to believe in or follow, the rider heads out with the only destination being the open road.  “Old Town Road” grew in popularity through numerous TikTok memes. Similarly to how the Atlanta duo iLOVEFRiDAY’s hit song “Mia Khalifa” blew up, clips on TikTok with the hashtag #oldtownroad have garnered millions of views.  After the song was removed from Billboard’s Country charts for “not (embracing) enough elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version,” Lil Nas X released a remix of his song with Billy Ray Cyrus to spite the company. The original eventually reached the number 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 on April 8, 2019.

The song’s title references Lil Nas X’s real name, Montero Lamar Hill.  The track first surfaced as a snippet on Twitter in July 9th, 2020. In November of the same year, Nas X stated that “Call Me By Your Name” would be the next song he releases, announced via Instagram Live.  On February 2nd, 2021, a Super Bowl ad for Logitech starring Nas X was released, using the song. It was revealed in the ad’s description that the song was called “Montero (Call Me By Your Name).”  Lil Nas X later partnered with MSCHF, a company that makes viral products, to make a special edition of Nike Air Max 97s, known as the “Satan Shoes.” The shoes sold out in under a minute and the final pair, #666, is being given out via a Twitter lottery. They were priced at $1,018, a reference to the Bible passage Luke 10:18, which reads: “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.”    The release of the shoes, as well as the music video for the track, which sees Nas sliding down a pole into Hell and grinding on the Devil, garnered controversy among religious and conservative groups. However, the backlash only helped the song’s popularity.",11,326,1812594

Nas explained what he meant by the song in a Genius suggestion:  Panini was possessive over Chowder in the show. She’s a representation of fans of who love you when you’re small. Once you get the spotlight they aren’t feeling you as much. The song is not a diss but anger towards that fan but also wanting them back.  On May 12, 2019, Lil Nas premiered the song in its entirety for the first time at the Rolling Loud music festival.",5,141,1030836

When tweeting about their relationship, Ariana states that Mac’s “inability to keep his shit together” was a significant reason why the relationship broke down and “Self Care” could also be Mac’s way of trying to learn from that mistake.  In the music video that was released along with the single, Mac is buried in a pine box to symbolize how the media tried to assassinate his character. In the casket, Mac lights a cigarette despite having no source of oxygen, displaying that he is confident that he will overcome his obstacles and make it out. With his knife, he carves “memento mori” into the lid which translates to “remember that you have to die” and he punches through it to save himself, a symbol showing that he refuses to die any time soon.",9,254,1311118

It is also the first single from Miller’s sixth studio album and first posthumous project, Circles. The track first appeared online on September 1, 2019. At the time, it was rumored to be part of an unreleased project that Miller was working on around the time of the release of his fifth studio album Swimming in August 2018. It was later released, along with an accompanying music video, and finally confirmed to be on his posthumous album, Circles, on January 9, 2020.  On the track, Miller discusses many of the same themes seen on his last record, Swimming. He speaks on feeling no reprieve from negative feelings in life, while the people around him only want him to say that he’s good, wanting him to suppress the negative feelings he has all the time.  The track’s music video features clips of Miller recording music, as well as many animated nature scapes depicting the positive parts of the world that Miller wants to find on the track.",2,172,1156118

He recorded “Shotta Flow” there, “Shotta Flow 2” there. That was where he recorded my first song at, actually. The first song he ever recorded. One Sound’s home, pretty much. Minus, he sent the beat to NLE’s phone. He did the “Shotta Flow” beat. He worked with him in the past. NLE was like, “Bruh, this beat a song,”. He was tryin to dissect it. He was like, “What i'mma do wit it?” And he had to just listen ‘til I really found out what he wanted to do with the beat. He usually freestyle on my songs. But he wrote most of this song. NLE wrote the hook. The hook especially ‘cause he knew that was the grabber of the song. That was the part NLE really, know what I’m sayin’, put my most focus on. When NLE said, “Before you try rob, hit your knees and pray to Buddha,” from that point on it was a freestyle. That was a freestyle from that point on. He usually, if I write, I don’t ever write two verses cause he don’t really have that much time. He write one verse and then he say, “Imma just freestyle the other verse.” When he made the song and it was done NLE was like, “Yeah, it’s hit, for sho.” He thinks with “Capo” NLE made it a bit more melodic and stuff just because he wanted to do somethin’ different. NLE tryin' to stay different. It’s just somethin' clicked in his head like, “Bruh, do this. This shit is gon' be hard.” And he changed it up, and when NLE made this song he was like, “Bruh, this, know what I’m sayin, it’s a slap on God.”",1,86,250830

Liz is compared to the famous portrait painting due to the dubiety of Mona Lisa’s smile. The smile can be interpreted as disingenuous, which therefore makes Liz disingenuous as well, unbeknownst to the boyfriend. Wayne and Kendrick play the two sides of the story; Wayne is the robber and Kendrick is the boyfriend.  The song was originally recorded in 2014, as it appeared on the tentative Carter V tracklist that Wayne previewed in October 2014. The first snippet of the song was brought to light in 2017 when PharmaBro Martin Shkreli played a part of the song live on Periscope, after acquiring the album from a man who bought Lil Wayne’s Bugatti, where a copy of the album was left. The version that Shkreli played live was later leaked in September 2019, along with the rest of the original Carter V album.   The song also notably contains references to Wayne’s relationship with Karrine Steffans, who is also known as Superhead. In an interview with BET Digital shortly after the song’s release, Steffans confirmed this, noting the song’s lyrics bared “similarities” to her relationship with Wayne.",24,453,1995732

While the song orients itself to being about a brother who was lost in Afghanistan, it was inspired by a father’s story about his son. Jared Monti was ultimately killed in the line of duty while trying multiple times to save a fellow soldier who was gravely wounded.  The inspiration came when co-writer Connie Harrington heard an interview with Jared Monti’s father, Paul Monti, on NPR’s show Here and Now, where Paul explained one of the ways he reconnects with his son’s memory, by driving his son’s truck.  The song is emotional and deep, and tells the listener of how the protagonist drives their bother’s truck to keep their memory alive, and portrays the pain they feel over the loss.",5,9,17828
Love Like Crazy,Lee Brice,"They called him crazy when they started out Said seventeen's too young to know what love's about They've been together fifty-eight years now That's crazy  He brought home sixty-seven bucks a week He bought a little 2 bedroom house on Maple Street Where she blessed him with six more mouths to feed Yeah that's crazy  Just ask him how he did it; he'll say pull up a seat It'll only take a minute, to tell you everything  Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse I love you Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense Never let your prayin' knees get lazy And love like crazy They called him crazy when he quit his job Said them home computers, boy they'll never take off He sold his one man shop to Microsoft They paid like crazy  Just ask him how he made it, he'll tell you faith and sweat And the heart of a faithful woman, Who never let him forget Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse I love you Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense Never let your prayin' knees get lazy And love like crazy  Always treat your woman like a lady Never get to old to call her baby Never let your prayin' knees get lazy And love like crazy  They called him crazy when they started out They've been together fifty-eight years now Ain't that crazy?","“Love Like Crazy” was country star Lee Brice’s fourth single. The song is an ode to a old fashioned man who lived a life of passion and taking big risks. It focuses on the long and happy marriage he had with his high school sweetheart, and the magnificent career he built starting from the bottom. In addition to being the type of “story song” that country music is so famous for, it’s also a song where the protagonist gives the listener good lessons on how to live your life like he did, by namely loving like crazy.  The song set some interesting records in country music.  By September 2010, it had remained on  the Billboard Hot Country chart the longest of any song in history. It also entered the chart’s top 10 in its 46th week on the chart, making it the song to climb into the top 10 the slowest. It ultimately went on to be a huge hit for Brice as it became a #1 song and was certified Platinum by the RIAA (1,000,000+ copies sold).

The “Tunnel Vision” music video shows Kodak standing in front of a burning cross—a reference to the KKK. The video also features a white man wearing a hat that says “Make America Hate Again"", a nod to President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” The man in the hat prepares to shoot a black man, but his gun fails, and the two come to blows. Finally, a little girl appears and shouts “Stop!” which brings the video to an end.",15,249,2397011

Kodak performed during the Florida A&M University homecoming festivities on October 5, 2018, and announced the song’s name and release date. One day before the song’s release, Kodak posted the cover art, which revealed that Offset was on the song, which was previously unknown. The song was released as expected on October 12, 2018.  The official music video was released on November 23, 2018. Travis Scott directed the video by himself. The video depicts the three rappers having a problem with the original film director, and hence things are the way they are.

The girl he raps about on the track originally didn’t want Tjay, but as soon as he blew up, she came back begging for him. Tjay knew she only wanted him for the fame, so he leaves her in his crime-filled past.  Additionally, he sarcastically samples and interpolates Justin Bieber’s January 2010 smash hit “Baby“ to show how he could’ve bought the girl anything if she was with him from the start.  Initially, the track wasn’t released on streaming services due to Tjay being unable to clear the “Baby” sample at the time so he, instead, released it to his YouTube on July 30, 2018.  More than two years later, on December 1, 2020, Tjay announced in an Instagram post that Bieber had finally granted him permission to release it on streaming services. It was released three days later on December 4, 2020.",3,51,333457

The song was also featured in the second trailer released for the film, and used throughout the film as a motif of Gatsby and Daisy’s relationship.  According to Del Rey:  It was an honor to work with Baz Lurhmann on his amazing adaptation of one of the most extraordinary books ever written. The movie is highly glamorous and exciting; Rick Nowels and I were thrilled to write the song for the film.  “Young and Beautiful” was penned by Lana and the film’s director, co-writer, and co-producer Baz Luhrmann, for the soundtrack. Del Rey wrote an earlier version of the song for her Paradise EP, but re-worked it with Luhrmann after he heard it and decided it’d work great with the movie. The song served as the film’s kickoff single, and an “orchestral single” featuring an orchestra was also released. Its motif, as well as samples of it, can be heard throughout the film and its soundtrack.  A jazz version of the song, created by the Bryan Ferry Orchestra, can be heard in the background of the scene that introduces Daisy.",17,132,1675352

This song became a sleeper success from a dance remix by Cedric Gervais. The remix entered the Top 50 in the UK, the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, and it topped the US Dance/Electronic songs chart.    The accompanying music video created great speculation over its underlying message. It depicts a tragedy where one woman (played by Lana Del Rey) jumps and the other (Jamie King), heartbroken, follows. Due to this, some claim that the song was written for a personal friend of Lana’s that committed suicide, or that it was written for a boyfriend that died years ago. However, there is absolutely no evidence of this, and many believe these speculations to be false in their entirety.",10,133,1186048

In true Lana fashion, the song raids the larder of American pop culture, with nods to Iggy, ’60s girl groups, and even Billy Joel.  After earlier teasing the collaboration on Twitter, the track was officially released on April 19, 2017. It’s the first song written for her eponymous album, it marks Lana and The Weeknd’s fourth collaboration following “Prisoner,” “Party Monster” and “Stargirl Interlude.”  Lana initially worked with the Swedish hitmaker Max Martin on the track, before finalizing it with the help of Abel and Nowels.  The title Lust for Life was first used for Irving Stone’s 1934 biographical novel about Vincent Van Gogh. The phrase had also been used to name songs and albums by Iggy Pop, Drake, Childish Gambino, Girls and Heavenly.",9,172,1058210

The music video was released on December 14th, 2011, receiving generally positive reviews. She spoke with MTV about its background:  For “Born To Die,” I wrote a treatment for it called “The Lonely Queen,” so that I would be in a setting that represented Heaven, sort of in like a remote castle in Romania. Walking through the halls flanked by tigers. And then she’d be flashing back to happier times in the arms of her love. And then Yoann Lemoine adapted that treatment and made it more doable.

The song showcases a brilliant balance of unfiltered outpouring and graceful specificity. Its accompanying music video spins a vivid portrait of Rodrigo as she drives aimlessly, longing for an ex-love.  The song was teased several times before its release in January 2021. On July 23, 2020, Olivia posted a snippet of the song on Instagram with the caption “wrote dis the other day. vv close to my heart. gonna call it drivers license I think lol.” She then posted another two snippets in December 2020, captioning them with “soon” and “sooner.” On January 4, 2021, she announced the song as her debut single.",12,328,3207505

The song’s hook is laced with sarcasm, as Olivia sharply addresses her former partner for quickly moving on from their relationship without much of an issue or any care towards her at all. Like with her previous single, “deja vu,” Olivia again experiments musically, this time using drums and a guitar as primary instruments to emphasize her anger building up as the song progresses. Its angsty, pop-rock sound has drawn comparisons to 2000s acts like Paramore and Avril Lavigne.  In the music video, Olivia plays a high school cheerleader who is feeling distraught and vindictive over her former partner. She purchases a container of gasoline from a convenience store and appears to destroy her ex’s bedroom, setting it ablaze and causing it to flood. In the final shot, Olivia submerges herself into a lake with glowing red eyes—a subtle homage to the 2009 cult classic Jennifer’s Body in which Jennifer stares into the camera with bloodshot eyes while swimming in a lake.  Olivia first teased the song and its music video on April 26, 2021, by posting an Instagram photo showing her dressed as a cheerleader. On May 9, 2021, the song was revealed to be her next single in SOUR’s album trailer shown at theatrical screenings of In The Heights. The next day, its release was officially announced by Olivia on Instagram.",5,148,1386373

Olivia questions both the authenticity of her ex’s new relationship, as well as their emotions for their new girl. She also portrays feelings of pity towards this new girl, who is not experiencing anything unique with her now-lover.  Despite sharing similar themes, “deja vu” is musically different from “drivers license,” with a more upbeat melody. It shows influences from Taylor Swift, both melodically and lyrically, especially in the bridge and outro. The music video shows Olivia spying on another woman—played by actress Talia Ryder—and emulating her life out of adoration, including wearing nearly identical clothing, traveling to the same locations, and copying her actions. Eventually, the woman makes it known that she was aware of Olivia’s stalkery the entire time, and taunts her, leaving Olivia enraged.  In the week preceding its release, Olivia cleared all of her posts on her Instagram account and began posting a series of cryptic videos, showing various clips on an analog television. Three of these teasers were shared before the official announcement of the song on March 29, 2021. The day before its release, Olivia posted an acoustic snippet of the song on TikTok.",9,179,1278987

They added that they thought the appeal to “Sober Up” from a fan’s perspective must have been from the universal theme of simplistic times in a person’s life.

Madison expressed the song’s writing process to Paper Magazine saying:  Charli XCX is one of the writers on it. She was so incredible to work with, and we had so much fun. I wanted to do something… that we kind of were like, when you break up with someone you hope they see you doing really well, and I hope it hurts like hell. I hope you realize that you should have given me the love that I deserve, and that you messed up. Offset’s verse was really important, that he captured that as well. I wanted to make sure it felt like we were both ganging up on the same person, and that we were both talking to the same guy. It came out exactly how we wanted it to you. I’m just really proud of it.  The music video for “Hurts Like Hell” was released on November 14 and featured Beer playing a witch. She was shown using magic to take revenge on an abusive man before getting caught up in a witch hunt. It was co-written and executively produced by Beer, who in a press release said:  I had such a clear vision of what I wanted to do for this video. I was inspired by witchcraft and felt that it perfectly fit with the theme of the song, which is about teaching someone a lesson.",1,60,209450

Florida Georgia Line rejected this song at first—they didn’t even listen to it all the way through. Singer Tyler Hubbard told ABC Radio: “A couple weeks later, we just were both kind of like, ‘Have you been listening to that “H.O.L.Y.,” that song?’ We both kind of fell in love with it over those few weeks of living with it, and realized the power. Sometimes a song doesn’t hit you right away.”  This song nearly went to an unbeliebable artist. busbee told Rolling Stone: “There was talk of Justin Bieber doing the song, and we had actually recorded it with another artist. Word came out that FGL were really into it—honestly we would’ve never thought to pitch that to them. We wrote it in L.A.; the other two writers are pop writers predominantly.”  Hubbard and his partner in Florida Georgia Line, singer Brian Kelley, were advised by their non-musical partners to do this song. Hubbard told Billboard: “There were three instances where our wives asked us about ‘H.O.L.Y.,’ and when we said we were considering it for FGL, they said we had to cut it. We feel like the song is anointed.”  On the Storme Warren Show, Kelley pointed out this song’s religious vibe. “It’s a beautiful, love, kind of spiritual, kind of worship song. The title of our album and tour is called ‘Dig Your Roots.’ For Tyler and I, there’s nothing more genuine and real and diggin’ our roots than singin’ a love song that sounds kind of like a worship song.”  This song crushed it on the charts—it rose to #1 on Hot Country Songs and #14 on the Hot 100.",0,37,99081

In the same interview, the singer and songwriter also shared his inspiration for this song, which came in August of 2018, when he was in Osaka, Japan touring with his sister, rising artist Billie Eilish:  I was in Osaka, Japan, FaceTiming a girl I’d never met every day and knowing there was nothing I could really do about it. I wrote this song about the day I would fantasize having with her.

I think the original thing I had was, I had a title … “You Got the Best of Me.” I remember Rob coming in and singing this thing … We had the melody thing … That was 2014. What happened was, I was still in college when I came and wrote with them and wrote the song; I was still in school, living in North Carolina. So we ended up writing it [when] I was just in town visiting. I went back to Boone and started playing the song out at my little gigs and stuff, and eventually came back to Nashville a few months later and recorded that song. I put it out that year – it was like July of 2014 – put it out on my own. I was like, “People already know that song.” There’s 50 million people that listen to country radio every week. So in my mind, I was like, “I’ve sold 50,000 copies of this. Everyone’s already heard this.” It had just been going so well. After this album came out, we were still playing it on the road, and the reaction to it was just always so good. It just kind of made sense to give it a chance. It went No. 1 on [the SiriusXM satellite radio country station] The Highway after “Hurricane.” They just wanted to play a song, so they played the version I recorded in college.",0,32,100070

Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines  [Pre-Chorus] Well, if you're anything like me You just might be doing whatever it takes To drown out the noise But I just wanna hear your voice  [Chorus] I’m one number away From calling to you I said I was through But I'm dying, inside Got my head in a mess Girl, I confess I lied when I said ""I'm leaving and not coming back"" Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain But everywhere I go, I see your face In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say But I'm still one number away [Verse 2] Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips? Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss? Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs? Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes on the moving on  [Pre-Chorus 2] Well, if you're anything like me You just might be doing whatever it takes To outrun the storm But I'm almost out that door  [Chorus] And I'm one number away From calling to you I said I was through But I'm dying, inside Got my head in a mess Girl, I confess I lied when I said ""I'm leaving and not coming back"" Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain But everywhere I go, I see your face In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say But I'm still one number away [Bridge] Will you pick up when I call? Or just forget we loved at all We don't have to talk I just wanna hear your voice  [Chorus] And I'm one number away From calling you I said I was through But I'm dying, inside Got my head in a mess Girl, I confess I lied when I said ""I'm leaving and not coming back"" Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain But everywhere I go, I see your face In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say But I'm still one number away  [Outro] Away, away Yeah I'm still one number away","Luke on the surface makes this song seem like a classic break-up song, where both parties in the former relationship are trying not to think of the other. Thinking of calling the other, being just one number away and trying to get their mind off of it with mentioned tasks like watching a familiar movie. As time goes on though, the person regrets ending it and “leaving and not coming back.”  However, when the music video was released, it tells a different story. Memories of a happy relationship intermingled with realities of pain, ends in a story that a man’s lover is killed in a car accident while on her way to him, presumably after a fight they had. She’s hit while on the phone with him saying she needs to tell him something, only to be interrupted by the accident.  The song can then be interpreted as the man constantly remembering his former lover, regretting and feeling immense guilt when during the fight he said “I’m leaving and not coming back” and wishing over and over again that he could dial her phone and tell her “everything I wanna say” and listen to her voice, just one last time.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct9BFr9XBaI&ab_channel=LukeCombsVEVO",0,18,94538

On the song, Uzi references the luxury watch brand Patek Phillipe while bragging about his sexual encounters and accumulated wealth. He also references pop-culture icons like Naruto, Transformers, and Rey Mysterio.  The instrumental is built around a sample of the title track from the Death Parade anime series.  The song was first previewed on Instagram in June 2018, and quickly went viral. During his performance at Lollapalooza 2018, Uzi revealed the song’s title to be “5 Min,” a reference to the song’s run-time of 5:43. However, based on lyrics from the snippet, fans labeled the song as “(New) Patek,” which ultimately became the official song title.  The single artwork is a screenshot from the snippet video in which Uzi was dancing to the song. The glowing hand and the keyhole are a continuation of the Heaven’s Gate cult references present in the album artworks.",25,275,1210705

The World 2, the deluxe edition of his second studio album, Eternal Atake.  Originally referred to as “Like Me” by producer Supah Mario before its release, the track was first previewed on Uzi’s Instagram on September 22, 2018. On November 28, Uzi previewed an extended snippet of the song in an Instagram live video.  Finally, on March 6, 2020, Uzi confirmed the track’s title to be “Myron,” along with implying its inclusion on the deluxe edition of Eternal Atake. The next day, Uzi teased two new  snippets from “Myron,” building up the hype for the track even further.  A large portion of the second verse differs from what was heard in previews of the song.

Love Yourself,Justin Bieber,"[Produced by Benny Blanco]  [Verse 1] For all the times that you rained on my parade And all the clubs you get in using my name You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't  [Refrain] And I didn't wanna write a song 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care I don't, but you still hit my phone up And baby, I'll be movin' on And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back Maybe you should know that  [Pre-Chorus] My mama don't like you and she likes everyone And I never like to admit that I was wrong And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own  [Chorus] 'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby, you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself [Verse 2] But when you told me that you hated my friends The only problem was with you and not them And every time you told me my opinion was wrong And tried to make me forget where I came from  [Refrain] And I didn't wanna write a song 'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care I don't, but you still hit my phone up And baby, I'll be movin' on And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back Maybe you should know that  [Pre-Chorus] My mama don't like you and she likes everyone And I never like to admit that I was wrong And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own  [Chorus] 'Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby, you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself [Bridge] For all the times that you made me feel small I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all I never felt so low and I was vulnerable Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

As with Justin’s recent singles  “What Do You Mean?” and “Sorry”, many listeners can’t help but think of Selena Gomez when they hear the track. On a recent interview on The Ellen Show though, Bieber named only three songs that are definitely inspired by his ex-girlfriend: “Mark My Words,” “What Do You Mean” and “Sorry.”. This doesn’t mean that the implied ex-lover is not Selena Gomez.  Given Ed Sheeran’s contribution, it’s likely an amalgam of Gomez and one of Ed Sheeran’s exes (Athina Andrelos? Nicole Scherzinger?), if the song is autobiographical at all.  The graffiti artwork for “Love Yourself” (Justin revealed the tracklist by posting pictures of the names of the tracks graffitied on walls all around the world) can be found in Oslo, Norway. This song premiered on Beats 1 Radio along with his Halsey collaboration “The Feeling.”  On November 14th, 2015 the official music video was released. Directed by Parris Goebel, it shows an arguing couple communicating by dancing around their house. The video stars renowned dancers, Keone and Mari Madrid.  On December 6th, 2016, it was announced that Justin Bieber’s single “Love Yourself” was nominated for two Grammy Awards: Song Of The Year and Best Pop Solo Performance  Fun Fact: On March 4th, 2016, Vanity Fair recruited renown African American actor, Morgan Freeman so he could recite the lyrics to this song in a witty and humorous way.  https://twitter.com/Beats1/status/663772277075410944",9,201,3993905
Sorry,Justin Bieber,"[Written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Justin Bieber]  [Verse 1] You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee? 'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight 'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances  [Pre-Chorus] Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry? 'Cause I'm missing more than just your body Oh, is it too late now to say sorry? Yeah, I know that I let you down Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  [Chorus] I'm sorry, yeah Sorry, yeah Sorry Yeah, I know that I let you down Is it too late to say I'm sorry now? [Verse 2] I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth Can we both say the words and forget this?  [Pre-Chorus] Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry? 'Cause I'm missing more than just your body Oh, is it too late now to say sorry? Yeah, I know that I let you down Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

Yeah, I know that I let you down Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  [Chorus] I'm sorry, yeah Sorry, oh Sorry Yeah I know that I let you down Is it too late to say I'm sorry now? I'm sorry, yeah Sorry, oh Sorry Yeah, I know that I let you down Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?","Capping off a year filled with public apologies, “Sorry” is an upbeat anthem about asking for forgiveness.  On its surface, the second single from Purpose seems to be an apology to a woman for making mistakes in a relationship—Bieber said the song is “a little bit” about his ex Selena Gomez. However, Bieber has also suggested that the song is intended to be a more general apology to the world for his mistakes.  On “Sorry,” Bieber collaborated with songwriters Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter (both of whom annotated the song on Genius). Michaels and Tranter also wrote six songs from Selena Gomez’s Revival album, including several songs rumored to be about Bieber.  “Sorry” was produced by Skrillex and BLOOD, and it incorporates elements of tropical house, an EDM genre that’s characterized by a bright sound and Caribbean or Latin influences. BLOOD explained the music’s meaning:  The vocal manipulations make an ambiguous sound and a moment later Justin replies, ‘Sorry.’ Justin’s vocal delivery and the triumphant key of the song gave the narrative a warm color. The beat is saying moving forward, and apologizing, can be exciting and fun.  “Sorry” premiered on UK radio station CapitalFM. It was posted on YouTube together with a dance video featuring New Zealand’s ReQuest Crew. The video, directed and choreographed by Parris Goebel, features a unique new dance style that Goebel calls “Polyswagg,” a style she says combines “sassy woman fire with aggressive inner strength.”  The song debuted at #2 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart, blocked from the top spot by the debut of Adele’s “Hello.” However,  10 weeks after its debut, it finally reached #1, dethroning Adele’s smash hit.",10,174,2275309

When asked about the song’s meaning, Justin referred to the indecision and veiled sentiments he often heard when talking to women:  Girls are often flip-floppy. They say something, and then they mean something else. “What do you mean?“ … I don’t really know, that’s why I’m asking.  To build anticipation, Justin enlisted a series of celebrities to help count down and preview the song on Twitter. Nine days before the official release, Justin leaked the lyrics in “the coolest way ever” (according to MTV) by sending them in parts to his loyal fans (the Beliebers) via direct messages on Twitter.  https://twitter.com/justinbieber/status/634038239624478721  The unique marketing worked. “What Do You Mean?” become the fastest song to reach number one on iTunes after its release, and debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, the 23rd song ever to accomplish the feat.  Surprisingly, this was Justin’s first number one hit.",6,113,1164716

It is the second single from the album, following “Someone You Loved.” As Lewis puts it in his well-renowned Instagram stories, this song is about him wanting a cuddle with his girlfriend of six months after she unexpectedly tells him that she hates him. Lewis says,  Nothing a couple of hugs can’t fix.  In another statement, Lewis said,  “Hold Me While You Wait” is a song I wrote about the uncertainty of being in a relationship when your partner isn’t sure what they want. There’s an impending hopelessness to the whole thing, on both sides, when they’re not sure whether they want to be in that relationship or not. For me it’s one of the most desperate places you can find yourself in.  “Hold Me While You Wait” debuted at #4 in the UK singles chart while “Someone You Loved” was still at #1. He became the second artist to have two singles in the Top 5, the first artist to accomplish this being Ed Sheeran. The song debuted at #1 in the Irish and the Scottish singles charts.",0,43,473409

You have to keep your head up and  always find positivity.  Nash Country Daily describes it as  “ about facing the world head-on and not letting life get you down”.  Old Dominion has performed the song in many different places. But a select few include The Grand Ole Opry and at the 2017 CMA’S according to Wide Open Country and Billboard  Old Dominion’s frontman Matthew Ramsey told Nash Country Daily “No matter who you are, where you live or your current status, people both old and young face more challenges than ever. It’s in the face of those challenges and standing at the edge of fear that we have to remain positive. Focus on the light that comes from positivity instead of being swallowed up. Work hard at doing what you feel is right. Don’t be scared!! Live life like there’s no such thing as a broken heart.”",3,15,66989

The song was written by Stevie Nicks at a turbulent time for the band.  She and Lindsey Buckingham’s relationship was coming to an end.  Christine McVie was in the process of divorcing her husband, band member John McVie and drummer Mick Fleetwood was in the process of divorce from his wife as well.  Buckingham’s “Go Your Own Way” can be considered a companion piece to “Dreams” as it details the other side of the breakup from his perspective.  Audio engineer Ken Caillat recalls the origin of the song,   Most of the material for the album was composed in the studio but Stevie used to get bored, sitting around while all the technical stuff was going on, so she asked if there was a room with a piano to noodle around on.  Well, the Record Plant told her she could use Sly Stone’s studio — a little sunken room that they’d built for him to work in — and one day while we were working on some track, she came in and said, ‘I’ve just written the most amazing song.’ ‘Really? Let’s hear it.’  So, she walked over to the Rhodes — which, like everything else, was always mic’d up and ready to go — and she played ‘Dreams’. Everyone else joined in, she did a guide vocal, and that was the keeper. It’s the only time that ever happened. She tried to redo the vocal again and again, but she could never beat the original. I actually wanted her to beat it, because it had the drums leaking into her vocal mic and, in a couple of spots where she sang softly, I had to ride it up and you could hear even more of the snare. Still, it was a one-off.",19,83,971093

It can also be seen as the chain that keeps the band together; linking the members together in ways that don’t allow them to truly part ways. Written in a time when the band members were not on talking terms due to breakups and rifts in the relationships they had, the lyrics are often said to have been attacks at each other, but the band also suggests that there is some underlying love that doesn’t let them completely part ways.    In 2017, 40 years after the song’s release, it was used in blockbusters Marvel Studio’s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” and Margot Robbie’s “I, Tonya” as part of the movies' soundtracks.",9,73,596842
Landslide,Fleetwood Mac,"[Verse 1] I took my love, took it down I climbed a mountain, and I turned around And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills Till the landslide brought me down  [Verse 2] Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?

It became a tale of love and life artfully woven behind the metaphor of a snowy mountain avalanche.  It was never originally released as a single (“Over My Head”, “Rhiannon” & “Say You Love Me” were the album’s three top 20 hits), but is considered one of the most known and cherished songs of the band’s decades-long career. In 1998, a live recording of the song reached #51 in the US.",7,61,548167

It was included as the B-side to the album’s lead single, “Go Your Own Way,” to which it’s something of a response.  Years later, the song drove a deeper wedge in an already strained relationship between Nicks and drummer Mick Fleetwood. Nicks sought to include it on a greatest hits package of her own material, but Fleetwood wanted it for a box of material celebrating the band’s first 25 years.  During the reconciliation for The Dance, the tune re-emerged, finding new life in its live version and emerging as a late-career hit for the band.  A road sign for Silver Spring, Maryland, helped inspire Nicks to write the song.",8,29,414426

This album was written during the fallout of many relationships within the band. This song was written by their lead male vocalist Lindsey Buckingham. At the time Lindsey was dating their other powerhouse female vocalist Stevie Nicks. They were together for eight years. Stevie Nicks has said that this song is the hardest to sing live in concert with Buckingham – but its considered a fan favourite song, so she struggles through it.  One story says that the band gave an early demo of the song to a Los Angeles DJ to test audience response. The DJ then responded, saying the song would not work on the radio because of its complicated rhythm. Only then did Lindsey Buckingham add the acoustic guitar, later saying that the acoustic guitar part  was the glue that brought the whole song into focus.  This song and album is regarded as one of their best songs/albums and one of the greatest records of all time.  This song was covered by NOFX on their 1989 classic album S&M Airlines.",10,48,197783
Gypsy,Fleetwood Mac,"[Intro] So I'm back, to the velvet underground Back to the floor, that I love To a room with some lace and paper flowers Back to the gypsy that I was To the gypsy that I was  [Verse 1] And it all comes down to you Well you know that it does And lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice Oh, and it lights up the night And you see your gypsy You see your gypsy  [Verse 2] To the gypsy that remains Faces freedom with a little fear I have no fear, I have only love And if I was a child And the child was enough Enough for me to love Enough to love  [Bridge] She is dancing away from me now She was just a wish She was just a wish And a memory is all that is left for you now You see your gypsy, oh You see your gypsy [Chorus] Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice And it all comes down to you And it all comes down to you Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice And it all comes down to you And it all comes down to you  [Outro] I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes And it all comes down to you I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes And it all comes down to you I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes (She was just a wish) (She was just a wish) And it all comes down to you Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice And it all comes down to you","One of the biggest hits by the band, “Gypsy” is both a nostalgic reflection on Stevie Nicks’s free-spirited life before joining Fleetwood Mac and a tribute to her late friend, Robin Snyder Anderson.  Written between 1978 and 1979, the ballad was going to be on Stevie Nicks’s solo album, Bella Donna. When Nicks’s childhood friend Anderson, who was also pregnant at the time, told her she’d been diagnosed with terminal leukemia, Nicks saw the song in a new light. She then decided to save the song for Fleetwood Mac’s next album.  In regards to the song’s ideas about going back to your roots, Stevie Nicks has stated:  “In the old days, before Fleetwood Mac, Lindsey [Buckingham] and I had no money, so we had a king-size mattress, but we just had it on the floor. I had old vintage coverlets on it, and even though we had no money it was still really pretty… Just that and a lamp on the floor, and that was it—there was a certain calmness about it. To this day, when I’m feeling cluttered, I will take my mattress off of my beautiful bed, wherever that may be, and put it outside my bedroom, with a table and a little lamp.”  Nicks has also spoken about the more somber inspiration for the song:  “The song Gypsy isn’t a real happy story. Gypsy is a lot about returning to San Francisco. And Gypsy was written when my best friend [Robin] died of Leukemia and uh …about the fact that she wasn’t going to see the rest of this: I still see your bright eyes, it was like she wasn’t …going to make it. And uh, I was like the lone gypsy ~ this was my best friend from when I was 15 and so I was a solo gypsy all of a sudden and it was very sad for me and that’s sometimes when I write my very best songs.”",7,34,134407

First released during his FARGO FRIDAYS series, it would later become the first single from his debut album I Told You. It is certified Platinum by the RIAA and peaked at #23 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, marking his most successful single before 2016’s “Luv”.  Produced by Andrew “Pop” Wansel, the track samples Brownstone’s 1994 hit “If You Love Me.”  Music critic Rick Florino said of the track:  [It] sees him confidently embrace this inimitable and infectious style. It’s airy drip transfixes just before building into an undeniable refrain. Somewhere between The Weeknd’s nocturnal decadence and Future’s space ruckus, Tory Lanez rules supreme. It’s ultimately enigmatic and engaging at every turn. However, you really just need to listen to it for yourself.",4,76,1248492

Lanez has mentioned on numerous occasions that he is coming for the number one spot no matter who’s there. Many would argue that Drake currently holds that position. The remix may have been made with the intention to provoke fans to decide who did a better job on the beat, hence, determining who is the better artist.  Following the 10 second snippet posted on Snapchat, Tory Lanez dropped the “Controlla” remix along with the “I Got The Keys (Remix).”  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqYGbgG9_7I",7,53,356585

Just like “Outro” and “Green Lights,” NF tweeted the first letter of the track—in this case, “L,” which could have been alluding either to “Let You Down” or “Lie.” Nine minutes later, he tweeted out the letter “E,” largely supporting the thought of it being “Let You Down.” The track was later officially confirmed to be “Let You Down” through a separate tweet.  “Let You Down” hit No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 song charts, marking his first song to even hit the Top 20. It also hit No. 12 on Spotify’s Global Top 50 airing with over 2 million plays a day, and No. 6 on Spotify’s Global Top 50.

He frequently declares her as being a liar by her late night phone calls and false accusations upon his reputation, and the relationship itself. After analyzing all of her actions that led up to this state, NF reveals she actually wants the relationship to continue rather than an end.  This track is produced by fellow producer, Tommee Profitt, providing us with one of the love-related songs from the album. It is also similar to some of his other songs such as, “3 A.M.” and “I Just Wanna Know.”",1,69,636588

I don't understand, it's got me questionin' like ""Why? Just tell me why""—not back to this flow Inside I feel divided Back when I ain't had a dime, but had the drive Back before I ever signed, I questioned life, like, ""Who am I, man?""

Ayy, yeah Why you always lookin' aggravated?

I knew the drums were dope and it could work for someone else, but it was just a bit poppy for me. After my experience with “Monster,” I had to tell him that I wanted 90 percent of the publishing.

[Outro] (Beluga Heights)","“Whatcha Say” is an apology song about a man who cheated on his girl and now feels sorry after being caught.  In an interview with Digital Spy, Jason mentioned that the song was based on his brother – “Basically my brother called me one day and said, ‘I cheated on my girl, but I love her so much and I hope she’ll give me one more shot’. I found his story really compelling, so I just went into the studio and tried it out. You know, people go through that kind of thing every day, which is why the song is so relatable. She did take my brother back though and they’re actually engaged now, so it all worked out good in the end.”  “Whatcha Say” became a huge success in late 2009, reaching the top of the Billboard charts on November 14.  (Fun Fact: This song was was originally written for Sean Kingston.)  Production-wise, “Whatcha Say” heavily samples Imogen Heap’s “Hide and Seek”.

She sang the theme song for Disney’s Ponyo with Frankie Jonas in 2009—she also voiced the title role in the English version of the animated film.  Noah Cyrus talked about working on her music and her budding career to Paper Magazine earlier this year:  My dad always had me sing alongside him while he played guitar. He taught me how to harmonize to an old song of his, “Missing You”. Writing is the best way to get your mind clear.  It’s also a great way to explain your past or what you hope for the future.  The song follows a slower beat with a theme revolving around toxic love and heartbreak. Her raspy vocals compliments the sound as she teams up with U.K. singer and producer Labrinth.",1,42,247129

The track was performed on Saturday Night Live, and was also nominated for record of the year in the 2012 Grammys. https://vimeo.com/56322097",4,236,3451202

It also touches upon the events Frank faced while living in Houston after relocating from New Orleans due to Hurricane Katrina. The song’s title is taken from the hook, in which Ocean raps about living a life connected by rough nights.  The song’s structure is divided into two main sides; the first part is rap-heavy, accompanied by pitched up guitar riffs to provide the melody. In the second part the music turns somber and slow, serving as a parallel to a crash after a drug high.  The change in tempo is used to signify the halfway point of the album, playing further into the idea of duality established throughout the album.",33,360,2932480

The song features OutKast member André 3000, who also plays guitar on the track. The song almost featured Big Boi grabbing a verse, but after discussion Big Boi and André decided they couldn’t do an OutKast reunion on somebody else’s record.  The production, like the entire album, is handled by Frank, but he got help from his friend Malay. Malay told Complex about working on the record and the selection of André 3000:   It was just a simple thing. There came a point when we knew we were getting close to wrapping the record. Frank was kind of narrowing down who he wanted features from. We knew we didn’t want to make it a record full of a whole bunch of big name collaborators just for the sake of having them. We were just really trying to decide who we could bring to this project that’s going to elevate the overall project.  That record’s an incredible song and it’s a lot of people’s favorite record when they’ve heard the album. And with a name like that you’d think it’d be a single type song or something. But if you listen to it it’s probably the opposite of that. It’s that record that’s everybody’s favorite song on the album but it’s not the single. That’s showing where Frank really is at. He’s strictly doing it for the art. It’s not about, “Hey, this is going to help sales.”",31,287,2431171

In a November 2016 interview with the New York Times, Frank admitted to altering his voice in order to make it sound younger to better encapsulate the emotions of young love.  The song may be about Ocean’s first love, which he detailed in his 2012 open Tumblr letter.

She is no longer revered but used and abused by men who would have died to protect her honor many centuries ago.  The song makes reference to the historical Cleopatra, who brought dishonor to her country by becoming Mark Antony’s mistress. Mark Antony was a conqueror who wanted Egypt as Roman territory, which is how they crossed paths.  In Ocean’s song, he narrates a similar happening with him and his woman. Now that she became a traitor and left him for the enemy, her decision has backfired on her—because she is not an entity of glory and honor anymore, but of dishonor. She is reduced to a common stripper who is now taking care of her man who has no job. It’s almost as if “the king” is paying her back for what she did, because the narrator speaks of his woman stripping to “keep a nigga bills paid.”  But there is still some kind of unhealthy love and devotion to one another because they still stay together, and are a couple so to speak. This song is literally a historical account of the Black man and woman in America and our slow fall from grace. From Gods to dogs, symbolically.",35,258,2152477

Its popularity grew quickly after the release of the film Furious 7, and the music video eventually became the first hip hop song to reach 1 billion YouTube views. It topped the Billboard Hot 100 for twelve weeks, becoming the longest-running rap number one since Eminem’s “Lose Yourself.”  This marks Wiz Khalifa’s second release from the Furious 7 soundtrack, his first being “Go Hard or Go Home” featuring Iggy Azalea.",9,237,4078228

It is a self-empowerment anthem that calls out haters. Katy has mentioned that her album is about a “360° liberation” and this song is about escaping pointless negativity. The central hook uses the image of a basketball player consistently scoring points, imitating the ‘swish’ sound of the hoop’s net.  Fans speculated the song to be a response to Taylor Swift’s 2014 hit “Bad Blood,” citing many lyrical references.  This was later confirmed when she starred in James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke interview. Katy explained:  She started it and it’s time for her to finish it. Now, there is the law of cause and effect. You do something, there’s going to be a reaction, and trust me, daddy, there’s going to be a reaction.  The song was indirectly confirmed days prior by EDM artist and ex-Taylor flame Calvin Harris, who said he “wasn’t involved” in a now-deleted tweet.",26,262,1625054

Perry teased the track in a pre-Grammy Interview with radio host Ryan Seacrest, stating that it’s “pretty sexual.”  On the summery dance-pop track, Perry boasts about her efforts to fulfill a lover’s sexual appetites. The track contains many food-related sexual innuendos. During her appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Perry said the song represented “sexual liberation”.  Perry hinted the release of the song by emailing fans a recipe for the “World’s Best Cherry Pie”.    The song marks the first collaboration between Perry and the Atlanta trio.",10,127,603768

The song deviates from the electro-pop sound on Teenage Dream in exchange for a mid-tempo pop-rock anthem similar to Sara Bareilles‘ “Brave.”  The song is a self-empowerment anthem that one critic described as a “stylistic return to the arena-sized singer-songwriter formula that made her debut One of the Boys so remarkable.”  The song was written by Dr. Luke and Perry’s longtime friend Bonnie McKee, both of whom co-wrote the singer’s other #1 hits “Teenage Dream,” “California Gurls,” and “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)”.",14,90,541715

A day later, Perry also teased a visual for the song.  “Never Really Over” marks Perry’s second time working with Zedd, following their 2019 collaboration “365”, though Zedd is not credited as a primary artist on “Never Really Over.”  The song’s lyrics deal with the end of a relationship and the possibility of the couple getting back together to have it fall apart again.  This could be an ode to her on-again-off-again relationship with fiancé, Orlando Bloom; who after three years, proposed to Perry on Valentine’s Day of 2019.  She says the song is about how all of our relationships – from first love, through failed love, to great love – all become a part of you so that none are ever really over: “You lived your past, and whatever it was, you learn.”",1,95,511789

The song was released as the third single, following the success of singles “California Gurls” and “Teenage Dream”.  Lyrically, “Firework” is meant to be an inspiration for anyone who’s ever felt worthless or unloved. Its message that everyone is beautiful and capable of leaving the world in awe really resonates with artist Katy Perry.  In fact, she has said that “Firework” is her favorite of all the songs she’s ever written. In an interview at the Grammy’s, she said that she was inspired to write the song after reading a paragraph in Jack Kerouac’s novel On the Road.",5,104,499020

It looks like you might be one of us","“Heathens” premiered in June 2016 and was the first new single from ​twenty one pilots following the success of their 2015 album, Blurryface, and its singles. Billboard hinted toward “Heathens'” impending release in an April feature of the band:  Tyler Joseph, 27, the two-man crew’s singer-songwriter, has just been Dropbox-ed a new mix of a tune that’s in contention for the soundtrack of a major summer blockbuster, and he’s eager to give it a spin. When the song – a moody, downtempo banger that could almost be a Rihanna track – explodes from the PA at full concert volume, it’s like a switch is flipped in some deep, primitive part of the singer’s brain.  The “blockbuster” would end up being DC film, Suicide Squad and it appears on the movie’s original soundtrack.  On Instagram, Tyler has occasionally referred to himself, and phones, and the amalgamation of self-and-phone, as “heathen” and “heathen machines.” This perhaps connects to TØP’s relationship towards mental health struggles—everyone is a heathen in their own judgmental eyes. Social media culture holds a mirror up to that otherness while also helping us connect to fellow “heathens” who are also searching for acceptance. This song in particular warns against placing judgment upon others, as we are all hiding our pain in one way or another.  “Heathens” may be an explicit warning to the Clique, TØP’s dedicated fanbase. With the group’s recent rise to fame, the band has seen an influx of new fans.  The Clique is now infamous for shaming “fake fans” for not being as dedicated as them, or not really understanding the songs. Tyler is asking the Clique to be empathetic towards their new fans and not to be so quick to call them “fake,” as they may very well have hidden psychological issues.  Of course, the lyrics are open to interpretation, and it’s possible to find themes related to the Suicide Squad characters—not necessarily the Clique.  Fun fact: the music video for Heathens was filmed in a real-life prison and the prisoners shown in it are actual prisoners.",11,535,2816173

The song is primarily about a wish to regain the innocence and carefree nature of childhood, before insecurities (i.e. Blurryface) existed.  It was released on April 27, 2015 as the third single from their second studio album, Blurryface. In February 2016, it managed to reach number two on the Hot 100, becoming not only their first single to reach that height, but also their first top five, ten, twenty, forty, or even eighty!  The music video features Josh Dun and Tyler Joseph riding big-wheels and hanging out in their childhood bedrooms, suggesting a state of crippling nostalgia and perhaps even arrested development.",11,296,2654170

As stated in the lyrics, the chemical is compared to a “vibe” or “beat.” While the chlorine has poisonous properties and could potentially cause harm, the narrator just can’t get enough.  A similar idea is found in an earlier song when Tyler says,  You gotta bleed to know That you’re alive and have a soul  In both cases, the concept of pain, or something which would generally be unwanted is flipped on its side and used as a metaphor for that which is beneficial.  On January 22, 2019, Twenty One Pilots released an official music video for Chlorine, featuring a tiny, horned, anthropomorphic bipedal monster they call “Ned”.",17,274,1227475

It was released alongside “Jumpsuit” on Wednesday, July 11, 2018 and was soon joined by “Levitate” on Wednesday, August 8, 2018. “Nico and the Niners” was first scheduled to premiere on some radio stations but was instead released ahead of schedule on iTunes and YouTube respectively. The word “Niner” comes from the pronunciation of the number 9 in the NATO phonetic alphabet.  The song has a somewhat upbeat tempo, with dark undertones. This is emphasized by the pitched down voice seen in the bridge and in the background throughout the song.  The album is an allegory for depression and it is supported by a website called dmaorg that documents the life of a fictional character named Clancy. In the story, Clancy lives in a walled city called Dema. The city is ruled by nine bishops who work to keep the inhabitants of Dema inside its walls. With the guidance of a group of individuals who call themselves “banditos,” Clancy eventually escapes.  This song acts as a rallying cry for the banditos, often repeating their claim that “East is up.” The song is a reminder that they are safe from the bishops if they wear their jumpsuit. As seen in the music video for “Jumpsuit,” the jumpsuits' defining feature is their bright yellow stripes. The bishops are unable to see this color, thus providing the wearer’s safety.  In a literal sense, the song is a rallying cry for the depressed from those who have escaped the grips of depression, the banditos. Tyler reminds listeners that the bishops, your emotions, and negative thoughts, do not control you. Furthermore, he points out the best time to seek help for depression is now, singing:  What a beautiful day for making a break for it  At the same time, he recognizes that not every attempt to get better will be a success, and it is not always easy to escape.  We’ll win but not everyone will get out",11,308,1046792

It led him to ponder where the mind takes people when all they are left with is silence.  Tyler describes this silence as something that can sometimes be seen as violent, an irony displayed musically as “Car Radio” moves from its brooding intro to the explosive climax heard during the bridge. Its energy level has made it both a band- and fan-favorite at twenty one pilots’ shows.",20,233,930380

The verses of this song are taken directly from Tyler’s “Street Poetry.”,11,180,885801

The song features all of the same artists who contributed to Khaled’s 2014 single “Hold You Down”, which is also his seventh top 40 hit. The song premiered on July 28, 2016 on iHeart Radio, and was later released on iTunes and Apple Music.  Nicki Minaj has appeared on three of the last four Khaled albums — she missed 2015’s I Changed A Lot and now’s back on Major Key. Rick Ross is the only rapper that’s been featured on every single DJ Khaled album since the first one in 2006, even multiple times on each record. In fact, his verse on “Do You Mind” is his twenty–ninth feature for a Khaled studio project, and definitely not the last one.",16,168,1092189

The song channels DJ Khaled’s inspirational “major key” Snapchat mantra and is the second single from the his ninth studio album, also titled Major Key. Jay Z references winning the “Big Pimpin'” lawsuit, being the first of his kind in the rap game, and owning his recording masters — delivering subliminal jabs at any artist who isn’t “free” like him. As of July 29, 2016 the track has peaked at #30 on the Billboard Hot 100.  In an interview with Rap Radar Khaled explained that he traveled to Jay’s house in Los Angeles to play him the instrumental in his in-home studio.  I play him the record and I’m vibing, you know, I got that eye so I’m looking to the side, I don’t want him to know I’m looking, and I see him vibing. The first part is an instrumental so that’s when I’m really looking because, the great ones, that’s when they really just start going so I look and I just see him start rhyming in his head and mumbling… When the beat stopped, he’s just like, “Leave that for me.”  The next day Khaled was called back to the house to hear Hov’s contribution. The video announcing the partnership between Khaled and Roc Nation contains the footage of the first time Hov ever spat this first verse for Khaled.    During his We The Best Radio show Khaled announced that the video would premier after 2016’s BET Awards:  This video is powerful. It’s iconic. It’s amazing. First of all, Jay Z don’t shoot no videos. He barely shoots his own videos. It’s very rare that you see the icon Jay Z. Very rare.  https://twitter.com/djkhaled/status/747543287989297152  Jay Z is known to not shoot many music videos, especially not for his features. But Khaled knew this was going to be an epic track, so he kept proposing to Hov that they shoot a video:  All our fans expect us … to go all out! I don’t want to drop this song without a video. Anybody else who got a Jay-Z song with Future would drop it right away. I held it … because if I had dropped it I wouldn’t have got the video. I told Jigga I want people to see and feel it. You the Don, so let’s give them a visual! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFLSOIufuhM",23,199,1054283

However, one decided that they did not care.  The song serves to empower women above the idea of a man as the center to all of their actions.

The video also features words at the bottom of the screen that are not lyrics, but are still important to the song’s theme:  One opted out An imbalance of power, shifted the whole tide It waved And waved  The cover art for the single was designed by SZA’s friend Sage Adams and is inspired by Henri Matisse’s “The Dance.”",4,117,2431483

It’s the first single she released with Atlantic Records since signing to the label in 2017.  The chorus and Cardi’s flow throughout the song is reminiscent of Kodak Black’s August 2014 song, “No Flockin.” The title’s also a play on Kodak’s name as “Bodak” alludes the “B” in “Bloods” as Cardi is a member of the Bloods gang, and “Black” is changed to “Yellow” as she’s a yellow bone or light-skinned.  In an August 2017 Billboard interview, Cardi revealed that she wrote the lyrics to the song while listening to the beat on an airplane:  I heard the beat […] on the airplane, I kept writing to it.",25,410,7979135

It’s the third single from Invasion of Privacy, following after “Bodak Yellow” and “Bartier Cardi.”  There was speculation that the song was aimed at fiancé Offset, who was plagued by cheating rumors in late 2017 but in an April 2018 interview with Ebro on Beats 1, Cardi revealed she wasn’t:  No, I wasn’t talkin’ about Offset, I was just talkin’ about things I relate to and that have happened to me. First of all, I heard the record before I even was in love with Offset like that.  Soon after the song’s release, an old video surfaced of songwriter, Pardison Fontaine rapping similar lyrics over the same beat, which led to others accusing Cardi of stealing. In actuality, Pardison and Cardi are friends (since 2014) and is credited as a writer of the song under the alias Jordan Thorpe.",11,181,2304029

I started going out with this girl for about four months. She told me she was pregnant, so I’m thinking it’s mine. At first I was buggin’ like, “Damn, I don’t want a baby.”  And then one day she disappeared on me, then I seen a picture with her and some nigga, she was pregnant and shit. I was just thinking like, “Damn this bitch really did me wrong.”   Although the song tells the story of getting angry after getting played by a sweetheart, in the end A Boogie’s romantic side shines through as he repeats the song title over and over: “I still think about you…”  In an interview with XXL, A Boogie described this track as “one of the five hits” on his debut mixtape, Artist. Revolt described it as an example of A Boogie’s “rare versatility and style that is freeflowing and allows for him to dance over […] lines of R&B”.",2,102,1938673

This was followed on November 21st, 2019 by a new, higher budget video via Vevo, directed by Adam Powell.  The song is blackbear’s spin on the #hotgirlsummer trend. Megan Thee Stallion fans, who originated the trend, inspiring the song “Hot Girl Summer” reacted negatively to the song, claiming that blackbear appropriated the idea. blackbear, however, claimed the song “has to do [with] the caption trend” and doesn’t parody the song. In fact, he teased the song and title during July 2019, before the release of Megan’s “Hot Girl Summer” on August 9th, 2019.  On the cover art of this playful, energetic track, Maddy Crum, who was previously featured in Aidan Cullen-directed short film, THE ANONYMOUS SAGA, is pictured with a face covered in colorful stickers and a nosebleed. She shared an Instagram story wearing merchandise and another using the official Snapchat filter designed by Harley Wrecks to mimic the cover a few hours before release.

It was put together just after he got engaged with her in Israel.  Hannah Lee previously inspired his debut album “Montevallo”, as well as the apologetic song “Drinkin' Too Much”.  Sam said  I’ve been taking songwriting a little too serious lately. With this lighthearted song I just wanted to do the opposite. The past songs I’ve written were less optimist than the ones I’m doing right now.  “Body Like A Back Road” is Sam Hunt’s most successful song to date. In June 2017, it broke a 55-year-old record held by Leroy Van Dyke’s “Walk On By” after Hunt’s track spent 20 weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. The song peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.",2,46,310288

Break Up in a Small Town,Sam Hunt,"[Verse 1] I knew I'd see her around I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back I'd act like I didn't see her We'd pay at the same pumps Flip through the same stations And slow down for the same curves Run around with the same crowds We just needed some time She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not I knew she'd find a way to get over me But I'd never thought that...

I realize the power of the Internet because I, as a listener, found lots of great music through YouTube and other outlets that you can access through the Internet, but I had never taken advantage of it as an artist and that was the first song that I put up and was able to sort of gauge a reaction from that. Nobody knew who I was. I never wanted to charge anybody through YouTube. I just wanted to share it with them and kind of get the thing going, get the music out there; that’s the most important part. You can tour, but if you don’t have any music available, nobody can find your songs anywhere. There’s really nothing to hold onto after they go to a concert.",2,22,58190

The song samples “There Stands The Glass“ by Webb Pierce, a 1953 Country hit. Sam said that country songs from the ‘90s represent his childhood.  When I heard this Webb Pierce sample for the first time, it clicked, and I knew that was gonna be the song that was gonna be the one we sampled  He continued by adding that he wrote this song afterwards just so he could sample “There Stands The Glass.“",0,10,38423

Being who he is in the industry, he knows that people want him to fail; however, God won’t let him do that.  Another key subject of the song is the separation Drake feels that he needs to have from those outside of his inner circle. Anyone who tries to work their way into his life must have an ulterior motive to benefit themselves.  The last key subject of this song is the fact that Drake is giving back to the life he had once, honoring the people and the environment he also once was in.  The official music video shared a different sentiment though, as Drake took the budget for the video, a whopping $996,631.90, and gave it away to families, schools, charities, and more. It was directed by Karena Evans, who also hails from Toronto, and is a protégé of Director X.  Director X has had a hand in a number of Drake music videos in the past, including “Hotline Bling” and “Started From The Bottom.”",19,595,8852814

The track rides on Drake’s heartfelt singing and honest lyrics, wondering if they still love him.  The track is produced by 40, TrapMoneyBenny and BlaqNmilD. BlaqNmilD had a hand at producing another track on Scorpion, “Nice for What,” which has similar New Orleans bounce influences.  The track is heavily based on vocal samples, a staple of New Orleans bounce. One included sample is Magnolia Shorty’s “Smoking Gun,” and City Girls' vocals are written to sound similar to that track. Also sampled is Lil Wayne’s “Lollipop.”  At the end of the song, Drake samples the seventh episode of the second season of popular TV show Atlanta, which is written, directed, and acted in by Donald Glover a.k.a Childish Gambino. This episode revolved around Drake and was aptly titled “Champagne Papi,” his Instagram username and producer alter-ego.  Days following the album’s release, “In My Feelings” garnered widespread media attention due to a viral video of comedian and Instagram personality, Shiggy, dancing to the song’s hook. The video evolved into the #DoTheShiggy challenge where people would try to replicate Shiggy’s original video. The challenge contributed to “In My Feelings” topping the Billboard Hot 100.  The music video for “In My Feelings” was released on August 2, 2018, starring Drake, Phylicia Rashad, La La Anthony, Shiggy, and Capito & Marley.",13,346,7281285

She’s had an on and off relationship with the 6 God a few times, and her Instagram account is a constant reminder that she’s never home – always traveling to exotic places, and out wearing almost nothing. Based on the lyrics, it’s as if Drake wrote this song while scrolling through her Instagram page.  This song premiered alongside “Charged Up,” “Right Hand,” and material from other OVO artists on OVO Sound Radio Episode 2.  It reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Drake’s then highest peaking single as a lead artist, only to be replaced by the Views single “One Dance” which peaked at #1.  The song heavily samples the song “Why Can’t We Live Together” by Timmy Thomas and has been remixed/covered by a seemingly ever-growing number of Drake’s peers, including Justin Bieber, Erykah Badu, Disclosure/Sam Smith, and Sufjan Stevens.  The official music video was released on October 19th via Apple Music, and was immediately made into a source of various memes involving Drake’s dancing. The song and choreography received much attention that Drake got to perform a segment of the infamous dance in a T-Mobile commercial that aired during Super Bowl 50.",9,290,6758885

True to his word, Drake performed the song live at OVO Fest accompanied by fan-made memes that dissed Meek Mill, a move taken straight from the Jay Z playbook. This is widely considered as the point where Drake won the beef.  The song cover shows Joe Carter, of Drake’s hometown team the Toronto Blue Jays, after he hit the winning home run from the 1993 World Series against Meek’s hometown team, the Philadelphia Phillies. The Blue Jays won the year before in 1992, earning “back to back” titles. Carter went to twitter to personally thank Drake for using his picture as cover art.  The release date of this track was no mistake, as the Phillies and Blue Jays faced off that same night (July 29th, 2015) on Sportsnet. Poetically, the Blue Jays came out on top, 8-2.    After Meek’s response track “Wanna Know” was released, Drake prepared a third diss track entitled “3Peat”, and played it at his OVOFest headlining show. However, the diss was never released in full.  “Back To Back” was nominated in the “Best Rap Performance” category at the 2016 Grammy Awards, the first diss track to do so.  In an interview on October 28, 2016, Meek Mill finally revealed what he thought about the track, stating:  I ain’t think it was no shit that people was gonna be like, ‘you got killed.’ I thought it was hot. Like when we shoot at niggas, you gotta shoot a nigga through the heart. When you wake up in the mirror, you looking in the mirror, you hearing what the nigga told you, some shit about yourself that you can’t even deal with. That’s how we battle where we come from.",22,433,4908268

Lucid dreaming refers to a state of consciousness where a person is aware they are dreaming. With enough experience, a dreamer can slowly begin to control the contents of their dreams. Juice uses the idea of controlling a lucid dream as an analogy for his mental state; to avoid the pain of seeing his ex-lover in his dreams, Juice seeks to replace them—for good.

What began as recreational drug use morphed into an addiction that ultimately led to his early death at the tender age of 21. Juice seemingly predicted his own demise on his June 2018 tribute to XXXTENTACION and Lil Peep, who also died young:  What’s the 27 Club? We ain’t making it past 21  On December 8, 2019, Juice WRLD suffered an accidental overdose at Midway International Airport in Chicago. He reportedly swallowed multiple pills after law enforcement attempted to intercept his crew upon suspicion of gun and drug possession. The Cook County Medical Examiner confirmed that fatal levels of codeine and oxycodone were present in his body—the latter of which is found in Percocet, or “Perky,” as it is called in the song’s chorus.  Before its official release, the song was previewed in March 2018 on Instagram Live. It was then leaked on October 6, 2019, with an extended verse.",11,184,1588247

Juice displays his emotions and how he feels when he was “robbed“ of his ability to love after the breakup with his girlfriend.  Throughout the song, he tries to entice his girlfriend into loving him through expensive watches and designer clothing, turning the relationship into a toxic, alcoholic mess. He stresses that his ex-lover put him into a state of insanity and he doesn’t want her to leave once he has run from her love.  This is the lead single to Juice WRLD’s sophomore album Death Race for Love. The track was originally leaked in early 2018 in a mass leak of Juice WRLD’s music. The song’s final mix was released on February 13, 2019, and its music video was released the following day, complemented with its Valentine’s Day release.",16,278,1352254

The song was made in response to the passing of XXXTENTACION on June 18, 2018.  Juice WRLD previewed this song on his Instagram live the same day he dropped it. As shown by the timeline of events, Juice created this entire song in just under a day.  In the song, Juice analyzes on the current state of the world through what he perceives as confusing and dark. He also talks about how unexpected X’s death was and resurfaced the event of Lil Peep’s death on November 15, 2017.  Additionally, he struggles with the idea of becoming a legend himself and questions how fame will impact his well-being. Having scored his first big hit with “Lucid Dreams” shortly before the release of this song, Juice is adjusting to a new way of life.  On April 19, 2019, he would further discuss his viewpoint on death in an interview with the New York Times:  It’s not as scary as I thought it was going to be, as far as graveyards…Damn near too much to take in, you almost gotta close your eyes, It’s so dead, it’s alive… It’s an interesting subject. It’s an enigma…I talk about stuff like that because those are subjects that people are a) too scared to touch on, or b) don’t do it the right way where people can learn from your mistakes. I cherish every mini-second of this life. What is this? The gates of Hell? If it’s meant for me to go out like this.  This song now sounds eerie as Juice WRLD himself passed away on December 8, 2019, six days after his 21st birthday. The song appeared to predict his own death as well, with lyrics claiming he won’t make it past this age:  What’s the 27 Clu-u-u-ub? We ain’t making it past 21",6,353,1346294

The song was released on May 22, 2018.  The song itself revolves around Juice WRLD’s self-admitted struggle with his (ab)use of drugs and the consequences they’re having on his life. Although he knows the substances really harm him, he cannot seem to quit and give up on getting high. Even the song shares a name with the recreational drug, lean. Which is the mixture of codeine cough syrup and soft drinks, most commonly sprite.  Unlike the previous two singles, “Lean Wit Me” was released on streaming services on the same date as its release, being his first track to do so.  The official music video for this track released on August 2, 2018. The video featured Juice at an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting, an organization whose goal is to “stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety.” The AA setting is also similar to Eminem’s “When I’m Gone” music video.",16,187,935694

The song draws inspiration from ‘70s rock songs from artists like David Bowie and Queen.  The track is Harry Styles' debut solo single after releasing five studio albums and going on four world tours with the global sensation pop band One Direction. “Sign of the Times” is also the lead single from Harry’s debut self-titled album and was released on April 7, 2017, over a year after One Direction began their hiatus.  The track was teased through television ads, though the release date and title were later announced by Styles on Twitter along with the cover art on March 31, 2017, which aptly coincided the 30th anniversary of Prince’s ninth studio album, Sign O' the Times. Although Harry’s song shares a name with a song of Prince’s, the similarities do not continue beyond that. A collaborator of Prince’s, Sheena Easton, has even stated that the “Purple maestro” would have approved.  “Sign of the Times” debuted atop UK Official Singles chart with the #1 slot and landed #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 after only the first week of tracking. Harry taking the top position on the UK charts meant that he had dethroned his friend Ed Sheeran, who had spent the thirteen previous weeks in that #1 slot. To accompany the song’s debut, a two hour pre-recorded interview done with Harry’s close friend Nick Grimshaw was aired on BBC Radio 1.  “Sign of the Times” made its live TV debut on Saturday Night Live on April 15, 2017, the first episode of the show to be aired across the entirety of The United States of America simultaneously. Harry performed a second song, a new track released with his album on May 12, 2017, titled “Ever Since New York”.  The music video for this song was released on May 8, 2017 and depicted Styles flying through the air above mountains and walking on water. Upon release, the music video shot to the #8 slot on the YouTube trending list.",8,261,3732268

It was first teased by Styles in a tweet posted on October 22, 2019,  also referencing his 2017 track “Kiwi,” commenting:   Kiwi walked so Watermelon Sugar could run.  In March 2020 NPR Tiny Desk Concert Harry elaborated on what the track is about:  It’s kind of about that initial euphoria of when you start seeing someone, you start sleeping with someone or just being around someone and you have that excitement about them.  In March 2021, Harry received his first ever Grammy Award for “Best Pop Solo Performance” with this song.",1,152,1738840

Interestingly, the cryptic image posted by Harry also features fish that resemble the logo of Eroda. “Eroda” is “Adore” backwards, tying the mythical island in the video back in with the title of the track. Harry was seen on set for the track’s music video by news agencies in Scotland on August 8, 2019.",0,123,1423168

The song was first heard by the general public in Switzerland, during the first show of Harry’s second world tour. Later in that same show, the unreleased “Oh Anna” was also performed for the first time. “Medicine” was registered on ASCAP databases in April 2019.  The meaning of the song is subject to debate, which is only perpetuated by the song being unreleased. Some of the themes suggested, however, are drug use and oral sex. The second verse has lead to some fans and spectators to call the song a “new bi anthem”.",4,199,986142

It was accompanied by a music video, which features Harry surrounded by scantily-clad men and women.

Prior to Fine Line tracklist reveal on November 19, 2019, fans had speculated that a song called “Cherry” would feature on the album.  Those who purchased tickets to see Harry during his 2020 Love On Tour noticed that the General Admission pits were named after two fruits, Cherry and Watermelon, with watermelon taken from his November 16 single, “Watermelon Sugar”.

Its music video — which was written and directed by Taylor and shot during the COVID-19 pandemic — finds Taylor shifting through different places by the magic of playing the piano. She revealed in a Tweet that everyone who was on-set took extra precautions to prevent the spread of the virus:  The entire shoot was overseen by a medical inspector, everyone wore masks, stayed away from each other, and I even did my own hair, makeup, and styling.  “cardigan” is believed to be the first part of folklore’s “Teenage Love Triangle,” told from the point of view of Betty. The storyline is followed by “august” and “betty.” Swift explained in a livechat the night of folklore’s release:  There’s a collection of three songs I refer to as The Teenage Love Triangle. These three songs explore a love triangle from all three people’s perspectives at different times in their lives.",22,222,2250021

Justin Vernon describes feelings of confusion about how quickly a lover moved on, while Swift offers a perspective about repeated warning signs that the relationship was no longer working. It’s also worth noting the contrast between Vernon’s rougher voice and Swift’s smoother one, which mirrors the contrast between their views of the relationship.  The song prompted many comparisons to Swift’s 2012 track “The Last Time,” another song that discusses the downfall of a relationship. Much like “exile,” Swift and featured artist Gary Lightbody’s voices contrast in tone, highlighting their differences.  “exile” is one of many folklore songs to contain a movie motif — other songs to do so include “the 1,” “this is me trying,” and “hoax.” It’s also her first collaboration with Bon Iver, who she called one of her “musical heroes” in an Instagram post announcing folklore.",6,209,2055540

The interviewer described the song as a “romantic, haunting, waltzy, singer-songwritery nugget.” Swift announced the song’s release date during an acceptance speech at the 2019 Teen Choice Awards. Three days later, the song appeared on iTunes, revealing that it’s the third track on the album.  The song is a romantic track dedicated to Swift’s partner of three years, Joe Alwyn. It takes a wedding-like perspective on their relationship and shares information about their romance. A Twitter user who attended one of the secret sessions alleged that “‘Lover’ is Taylor’s favorite [original] song of all time,” having asked her directly during a Q&A.  On the day of its release, “Lover” reached number #1 on the US iTunes charts, making it her 35th song to do so. With this milestone, she extends her record as the female with the most #1 singles in iTunes' history.  The music video for the song was released on August 22, 2019, immediately following Swift’s Lover’s Lounge on YouTube. It features Swift and her love interest in a house inside a snow globe, illustrating the ups and downs of a relationship in progress. During Swift’s livestream, she further revealed that the concept for the music video originated from a lyric in her 1989 song, “You Are In Love”:  And so it goes You two are dancing in a snow globe, ‘round and 'round",17,153,1915250

Taylor contemplates an alternate life in which her old wishes had “come true” and resulted in a relationship with an ex-lover.  Sharing a similar sentiment to Swift’s track “I Almost Do” from October 2012’s Red, “the 1” is a callback to the folk moments from the same record, folk music being a defining influence on folklore.",14,150,1823893

The song’s themes are of revenge and rebirth into a smarter, stronger person. It sees Swift move in a new sonic direction, incorporating electropop and an unexpected interpolation of the 90s hit “I’m Too Sexy” on the chorus.  In the week leading up to the track’s release, Swift cleared all previous social media presence and released three videos of a snake’s tail, body, and head; most considered this a reference to her widespread reputation as a “snake.” She then revealed the album title and cover, and announced the release dates for both the album and the single.  A short preview of the music video was aired on Good Morning America the morning of the song’s release; the clip was later posted to Swift’s social media accounts and official site. The full video premiered during the MTV Video Music Awards on August 27th, 2017 — check out the analysis here! The video made both VEVO and YouTube history, amassing the most views within 24 hours in history on both platforms.  On the reputation Album Release Party, Taylor revealed that “Look What You Made Me Do” started out as a poem:  It actually started with just a poem that I wrote about my feelings, and it’s basically about realizing that you couldn’t trust certain people, but realizing you appreciate the people you can trust. Realizing that you can’t just let everyone in, but the ones you can let in, you need to cherish. And it had all the verses in it, just basically as is.  Later on, after the music video of “Look What You Made Me Do” was released, Taylor herself came out to explain the true meaning behind the LWYMMD music video:",12,281,1671465

Would you want me? Would you tell me to go fuck myself Or lead me to the garden? In the garden, would you trust me If I told you it was just a summer thing?

I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything But I know I miss you  [Outro] Standing in your cardigan Kissin' in my car again Stopped at a streetlight You know I miss you","“betty” touches on the aftermath of “august,” which describes a summer love that was doomed from the start. Listeners learn that while the summer affair was going on, the speaker, James, was still dating their classmate, Betty.  The song takes a more feminist approach, portraying the narrator as a person named James who can’t own up to their mistakes, all while Betty flourishes on her own and recognizes her worth.  Sonically, the song exudes a strong sense of nostalgia, delivering production and instrumentals reminiscent to Taylor’s earlier projects like Fearless and Speak Now, both of which were records written by Taylor in her similarly naïve adolescence.  “betty” is believed to be the third part of folklore’s “Teenage Love Triangle,” told from the point of view of James. The storyline is preceded by “cardigan” and “august.”  Interestingly, James' gender is never explicitly stated—James and Inez (mentioned in the pre-chorus) are, in fact, the names of Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds‘ eldest daughters—leading some to believe that James could be a girl and that the Teenage Love Triangle is, in fact, a sapphic love story.  However, Taylor confirmed James' gender while explaining the song on country radio:  [James] has lost the love of his life basically and doesn’t understand how to get it back…Everybody makes mistakes, everybody really messes up sometimes and this is a song that I wrote from the perspective of a 17-year-old boy. I’ve always loved that in music you can kinda slip into different identities and you can sing from other people’s perspectives. So that’s what I did on this one–and I named all the characters in this story after my friends' kids.""",14,185,1563327

Before it was announced, “Eddie” and “Future” were written in graffiti in certain shots of the “…Ready For It?” music video.  “End Game” revolves around the idea of Taylor wanting to be her lover’s soulmate. While she never mentions who this person is, the Internet seems to be convinced that since he has a huge “reputation,” he must be Tom Hiddleston, whom Taylor was in a relationship in 2016, or Joe Alwyn, her boyfriend as of the song’s release. Through the lyrics, Taylor hopes that the “drama” revolving around her doesn’t keep this guy from being with her because they’ve already been so close.

On the same day as the album’s release, the official music video was uploaded to YouTube. The beginning of the video also contains “!!!!!!!”, the intro of WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?. Billie confirmed that the song would be receiving a music video with a comment on Instagram under a fan post.  On August 19th, the song reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 making her the first person born in the 21st century to have a #1 and dethroning Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road”, who held the #1 spot for 19 consecutive weeks. Lil Nas X congratulated Billie on her achievement through a tweet:  https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1163547042376900610  A remix featuring Justin Bieber was released on July 11, 2019.",4,273,3013999

Billie explained that the meaning of this song is directly opposite to the meaning of her other popular song, “COPYCAT.”  “COPYCAT” is basically about someone doing fucking everything you do. The idea of “idontwannabeyouanymore” was sort of like, exactly the opposite. You know, “COPYCAT” is like “you wanna be me so bad, I’m the shit” but really, no I’m not. And it’s like, you wanna be me. I look at the mirror over here, I don’t wanna be you.  https://youtu.be/-BzvCCzH-n0?t=31     In January 2019, thanks to the viral video of Eilish singing the track on Genius' Verified episode from May 2018, the 2017-released song soared up the Genius charts.

When we all fall asleep, where do we go?","According to a January 2019 Alternate Press article, “bury a friend” is written from the perspective of a monster under Billie Eilish’s bed. The track details a confusing relationship with this ‘entity’ and ambiguously sets her up to be the monster itself.  A snippet of “bury a friend” was teased by Eilish on her Instagram page, as well as on Twitter and YouTube, on January 28, 2019. The visual depicts Billie’s face being grabbed by several gloved hands that reach in from off screen, until the closing lyrics and album title are displayed. She posted on Instagram the following day, announcing her debut album would be titled WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?  The song itself features a Prismizer effect, which manipulates pitch and frequency characteristics to achieve a choral phase, much like Eilish’s other January release, “WHEN I WAS OLDER.” Her friend Mehki Raine makes a few short appearances on the song and seems to be talking directly to Eilish.  Many fans believe an episode of sleep paralysis, which Billie shared on her Instagram story, was one of the inspirations for the song. In a reply to an Instagram comment, Eilish alluded to the validity of this theory.    On February 22, 2019, Billie posted a video in collaboration with YouTube Music, where she and her brother Finneas explain the meaning behind the song and the creation of it. When asked by Radio Energy for her favorites from the album, Eilish chose “bury a friend” as one of them.",6,273,2448319

The song’s chorus features vocal harmonies by her brother, FINNEAS.  On May 13th, 2018, she teased a 15-second snippet of the demo to her fans. This snippet was re-posted to her Instagram story on January 2nd, 2019, where she confirmed it to be the twelfth track on her debut album. However, it was replaced by “listen before i go,” becoming the thirteenth track instead.  When asked by Radio Energy for her favorites on the album, Eilish listed “i love you” as one of them, citing the track as, “still one of my favorite songs I’ve ever written in my life.”  In an interview with PopBuzz, Eilish confirmed that the final three song titles on the album were intended to form a sentence, beginning with “listen before i go,” then “i love you,” ending on “goodbye.” The sentence was initially supposed to begin with a track titled “i dont know, i just wish i wasnt breathing,” but Eilish stated that the song was never completed, and therefore could not be included on the record.  At 4 minutes and 52 seconds, “i love you” is the longest track of Eilish’s discography.  Many have also pointed out similarities between the chorus of “i love you” and Leonard Cohen’s iconic song, “Hallelujah”.  The song’s Spotify artwork was done by @junkie.cowboy on Instagram.",1,180,1755148

At the time, Billie thought he didn’t like her because she was a “shitty person.“ She wanted some other reason for him not liking her, such as him being gay. Ironically, after she wrote this song, she found out he really was gay after all.  Eilish made an Instagram post with a small snippet of the song the day before its March 4, 2019, release.  She also revealed on Instagram that it took her three years to release the song once it was written. However, a demo version circulated for many years before its official rerecording and professional release in 2019.  Eilish addressed accusations of homophobia in a Pop Buzz interview.",9,228,1653480

I walked into the studio with my producers, Paul and Jason, and they asked “What’s going on in your world? How has it been?”, it was the first time we had written since “How Can It Be.” I was feeling overwhelmed that much had happened the night before. How do I come back down to normal? How do I come back down to reality?  This brought up the issue of identity and trying to figure out how to exist when I feel like so many things were pulling me in so many different directions. We pretty quickly finished the writing and demo recording that day.  Over the course of two years of touring, I would sing “You Say” every night.  I remember starting to hear fans sing along to a song that had never been heard before. When it came time to make the record, it was a really fun process to have the challenge presented with something that I felt like I’d been living with. I felt like I got to a place of expressing this song exactly how I wanted to sing it.",0,83,553147

Right then in Wichita, I loved how the crowd would engage and how it resonated with everyone — but the depth of this song and these lyrics didn’t strike me to the core right away.  This song means more to me now than it ever has.  I want people to listen to this song and be reminded that even when they don’t feel like themselves, they can find comfort in knowing that there are people who can see beyond their darkest moments.

The beef began when the two collaborated on Gucci’s 2005 track “So Icy,” which both rappers claim as their own song.  Later that year the beef took a deadly turn when Jeezy put a $10,000 bounty on Gucci’s ice cream cone chain in his song “Stay Strapped:”  Matter of fact, real talk nigga, I got a bounty on that shit nigga, ten stacks…to snatch that motherfucker off his neck  Five armed men, in an attempt to snatch the chain, broke into a home Gucci Mane was in. After a brief struggle, Gucci shot and killed one of the assailants, Pookie Loc, a rapper signed to Jeezy’s label. Weeks later, after the body was discovered buried by a middle school, Gucci Mane was charged with murder. This incident inspired these infamous bars from “Truth:”  Go dig your partner up, nigga, bet he can’t say shit And if you looking for the kid, I’ll be in Zone 6",20,50,317791

It said pork soda in big scrawling letters, I thought it was the best tattoo I’ve ever seen. It was this woman, she gave us a load of gifts, it was amazing, 30 little glass animals. I saw her tattoo, and I was like, ‘that’s sick – why?’ And she was like, ‘I just like pork soda,’ and I thought that was really cool, it played into the mentality of the person in that song. I just really liked the phrase. It’s a drink. It’s a drink and it’s a meal, they put pork and cook it in coca cola in a stew. She says it’s the best meal and a drink.  Dave shared his photo of the pig tattoo on the band’s Facebook page:    This song, according to Genius, is about the man second from the left in the back row of the album cover.",12,52,229742

He expressed his motive for creating the song in a tweet that was deleted moments after posting it, he explains:  I’m tryna to empathize that I understand why she’s fighting her feelings  In the first verse, he is actually telling the story of how he neglected his first girlfriend. His first girlfriend is the same girl that he raps about in a song released two months before this one, “First One”; it goes more into depth about the girl, their relationship, and what he did to push away the only girl who genuinely cared for him.  Due to the way Russ treated his ex, she now finds it hard to give her love and trust to another man. In the second verse Russ explains that the new guys intentions were nothing like his were. Even though the new guy is proving to her that he isn’t going to take her love for granted she still battles an internal conflict because of her relationship with Russ.      The official music video was released to YouTube on February 1, 2016. The video is directed by Edgar Esteves and features Russ himself, along with YouTube beauty vlogger Taylor Layne.",6,131,2831025

She fell on the steps of her home and had to receive 40-50 stitches on her face.  In “Cry Pretty”, she exposes her vulnerability and insecurities and gives power to them, empowering and enabling others to feel comfortable doing the same. She tells listeners to join her in embracing their emotions even when they aren’t “pretty”. It is common for people in this society both men and women, to suppress their emotions because they feel they will be viewed as weak or ugly if seen crying or under turmoil. She sends a message to those fans about how unrealistic it is for them to expect to be able to maintain an attractive appearance when going through distress and to embrace how they look. This song promotes healthy expectations, body love, anti-shame and general acceptance.",1,22,157784

Underwood announced “Smoke Break” and accompanying album Storyteller in a video posted to Facebook, in which she also described its meaning:  The song itself is … one of those story songs that I feel like everyone can relate to about how life is so hectic and it’s so nice if and when you actually get to kind of step away for a second. We all need that time to ourselves, to get to take a break.  According to USA Today, the track came to life while getting stuck working one of the other tracks on Storyteller:  We were writing and kept taking breaks to go outside because we were getting a little stuck on a song we were already working on. It was so beautiful outside, that we had a hard time focusing so we decided to write a song about taking breaks! “Smoke Break” seemed like a great title, so we ran with it!",8,17,40546

It contrasts popular culture’s perception of black experience and its often brutal reality by juxtaposing happy, carefree choruses and dark, aggressive verses.  This contrast may also allude to the cyclical shifts in mood whenever there is a shooting in America. One second, the entire nation is in an uproar, the next, they are happy and unconcerned, placated by pop culture trends.  In the music video, directed by frequent Gambino collaborator Hiro Murai, Gambino portrays this comparison by dancing around gleefully with school-aged children, seemingly unbothered by the chaotic scenes of violence in the background. However, in the short film’s final scene, Gambino is seen running frantically through a darkened warehouse trying to escape the mob that now chases him; a reminder that if America chooses to remain willfully ignorant to its problems, they will inevitably be the country’s downfall.  “This is America” is Gambino’s first single since he dropped the 2016 studio album Awaken, My Love!. The song’s release coincided with Gambino’s appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he performed the new track, along with “Saturday,” another new track.  https://gph.is/2KEAKMc",19,557,5154559

But stay woke But stay woke","“Redbone” is about paranoia and infidelity in a relationship. As a slang term, “redbone” distinguishes a lighter-skinned black person of mixed race. Bino fears that his efforts to keep this woman satisfied will drive her away.  In a Genius video, Ludwig Göransson, the song’s producer, recreated “Redbone” and explained that it was heavily inspired by Funkadelic, George Clinton’s 1970s psychedelic funk band. According to Göransson, Gambino even sent him Funkadelic’s music as a reference point for the production, which was created mostly on live instruments.  Gambino first revealed “Redbone” at his Pharos concert experience, but it officially premiered on BBC Radio 1 as Annie Mac’s Hottest Record. The track received worldwide recognition shortly thereafter, shooting to #12 on Billboard’s Hot 100 list. It got a second wind almost four months later when parodies of the song turned it into a meme.  “Redbone” was featured in the opening credits of Jordan Peele’s horror film, Get Out. In a February 2017 interview with Hip Hop DX, Jordan revealed why he picked the record for the movie:  Well, first of all, I love the “Stay woke”–that’s what this movie is about. I wanted to make sure that this movie satisfied the black horror movie audience’s need for characters to be smart and do things that intelligent and observant people would do.  The song won a Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance at the 2018 Grammys held on Jan. 28, 2018.",7,332,4302809

The song is an evolution of the more acoustic sound put forth in Maroon 5’s sixth studio album, Red Pill Blues, and specifically their #1 hit, “Girls Like You.”. Lyrically, the song is a reflective look back at the past, while also paying homage to those in our lives who may no longer be with us.  Structurally, the song is a reimagining of “Pachelbel’s Canon”, a famous late 17th/early 18th-century canon created by German Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel. The progression of “Memories” borrows from the harmonic sequence of “Pachabel’s Canon”, with additional changes made by the song’s diverse team of songwriters who include Billboard-charting hip-hop recording artist Jon Bellion and members of the production and songwriting team The Monsters & Strangerz.",2,98,1577829

Produced by Young Shad and Ricky Racks, Thug comes hard with his crooning and braggadocios style to brag about his bestie.  This song was met with controversy upon release when Louisiana rapper Tokyo Vanity threatened to sue Thugger. According to Complex Magazine, Vanity is threatening to sue Thugger for copyright infringement, claiming he stole her song “That’s My Best Friend.”  The Fader interviewed the director of the music video, Be El Be, who shared his opinion on who Thuggers “best friend” really is:  If [Young Thug is] his own butler, if he’s catching himself with himself, making love to himself, if he’s in the bathroom getting changed and it’s just him and him—it’s showing his best friend is himself. That self-esteem! He’s a very stylish young man, so I would say that the inside meaning of that is that he is his own best friend.  On September 14th, 2015 the official music video was released by Young Thug. It is co-directed by Be El Be and the visuals show Thugger running into himself in everything he does. Pitchfork said it best (in regards to describing the video):  Young Thug’s video for “Best Friend” begins with Young Thug walking in on Young Thug, who’s in the process of hooking up with Young Thug. Then, Thug jumps in a car driven by Thug. Eventually, Thug’s head is served at a dinner attended by Thug.   Fun Fact: 5 months later from the release of the music video, Young Thug read out the lyrics on GQ  so people can understand him better and simply for laughs and giggles!  https://youtu.be/IVRXJ1Gd33g",20,166,1789535

Cole, and Travis Scott rap about what they would do with their significant others at “The London,” which could refer to a luxury hotel in either Beverly Hills or New York. They also boast their stature, wealth, sexual prowess, and ability to sell drugs. It is the lead single from Thug’s 2019 project, titled So Much Fun, and his first official release since his September 2018 EP, On the Rvn.  The single was first teased on May 11, 2019, when flyers were thrown out to attendees of Thug’s set at Miami’s Rolling Loud Festival. They featured the first line of Thug’s verse on the track and teased the song’s artwork and color scheme. https://twitter.com/1sabsad/status/1127412788354330624  The song was teased again on May 21, 2019, during a since-deleted live stream on Thug’s YouTube channel titled “Meet Me At The London,” which spanned over the course of more than twelve hours. The live stream focused on a woman painting a spider on a green canvas, again foreshadowing the song’s artwork. Travis' involvement was also teased by a woman filling a cactus-shaped piñata with candy.  “The London” received an official release two days later with less than an hour’s notice.",33,218,1391791

He shows a vulnerable side in the melancholic track, pleading with his lover to stay. In a September 2013 interview with SKEE TV, Chris revealed that Lamar wrote his verse from the “mindset of a critic” who was coaching Chris through the song. in addition, Chris also praised Lamar’s lyricism and ability to paint a picture with his words.  “Autumn Leaves” was never released as a single, but a music video was shot for the track in Hawaii, with Chris' on-off girlfriend Karreuche Tran as the leading lady. This may allude to the fact that the track was written about their relationship.  “Autumn Leaves” marks the second collaboration between Chris and Kenny, following March 2013’s “R.I.P.

Year 3000,Jonas Brothers,"[Verse 1: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas] One day, when I came home at lunchtime I heard a funny noise Went out to the backyard to find out If it was one of those rowdy boys Stood there with my neighbor called Peter And a Flux Capacitor  [Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas] He told me he built a time machine Like one in a film I've seen, yeah  [Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas] He said, ""I've been to the year 3000 Not much has changed, but they lived underwater And your great-great-great-granddaughter Is doin' fine, doin' fine""  [Verse 2: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas] He took me to the future in the flux thing And I saw everything Boy bands, and another one, and another one And another one Girls there with round hair like Star Wars Float above the floor [Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas] We drove around in a time machine Like one in a film I've seen, yeah, woo  [Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas] He said, ""I've been to the year 3000 Not much has changed, but they lived underwater And your great-great-great-granddaughter Is doin' fine, doin' fine""  [Bridge: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas] I took a ship to the year 3000 This song had gone multi-platinum Everybody bought our seventh album It had outsold Kelly Clarkson I took a ship to the year 3000 This song had gone multi-platinum Everybody bought our seventh album (Seventh album, seventh album)  [Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas] He told me he built a time machine Like one in a film I've seen, yeah  [Chorus: Nick Jonas] I've been to the year 3000 Not much has changed, but they lived underwater And your great-great-great-granddaughter Is doin' fine, doin' fine, oh [Chorus: Nick & Joe Jonas, and Kevin Jonas] He said, ""I've been to the year 3000"" (Yeah, yeah) ""Not much has changed, but they lived underwater"" (Oh, yeah) ""And your great-great-great-granddaughter Is doin' fine, doin' fine, doin' fine""  [Chorus: Nick & Joe Jonas, and Kevin Jonas] He said, ""I've been to the year 3000 Not much has changed, but they lived underwater"" (Oh, yeah) ""And your great-great-great-granddaughter Is doin' fine, doin' fine""  [Outro: Nick Jonas] He said, ""I've been to the year 3000 Not much has changed, but they lived underwater And your great-great-great-granddaughter Is doin' fine, doin' fine""","The Jonas boys put a fresh spin on the Busted classic.  By covering what could be interpreted as a banal tune the Jonas brothers make an elaborate statement about the state of art. This shifts a fun jam from Busted, into a profound message about the lack of human imagination. By imagining the year 3000 and being thoroughly unable to describe any of the wonders there, the brothers are noting the inability of art provide what Jonathan Lear calls a ‘radical hope’ of a future that is entirely beyond modern cultural constructs.  Some lyrics were changed from the original song to suit JB’s young audience, including:   “And your great, great, great granddaughter is pretty fine” to “and your great, great, great granddaughter is doing fine” “Triple-breasted women swim around town totally naked” to “girls there with round hair like Star Wars float above the floor”    In addition, the line “it had outsold Michael Jackson” was changed to “it had outsold Kelly Clarkson” to accommodate the charts of the time — at the time of release, some of Kelly’s most recent hits were “Behind These Hazel Eyes” and “Since U Been Gone.”  All of these line changes both serve to make this song family-friendly and to emphasize how little is actually described about the future.",6,37,128001

In the darkest tunnel, there is still love & music. That’s what it’s here for. Here is Dear Hate.”  The song received an immediate, overwhelmingly positive response, leading to plans to release the track to iTunes and streaming services on Friday, October 6, with all proceeds going to the Music City Cares Fund—a charity specifically created to help the victims in Las Vegas. Continued positive response to “Dear Hate” led iTunes and streaming platforms to push the release date forward to October 3.  https://twitter.com/MarenMorris/status/914963639374839809",4,16,61218

Over a menacing beat composed of multiple samples, Logic cemented himself as one of the most notable young hip-hop talents with his steady wordplay and strong flow. The track was also self-produced, adding to how impressive this song is.  The official music video, which featured an alternate variation of the track, was premiered on October 9th.

In this song Logic struggles with his nicotine addiction which he refers to as Nikki; note the similarity of pronunciation – Nikki and nicotine. Logic understands that Nikki is not good for his health and is doing everything in his power to not go back with her, but lately Logic has been feeling like a slave for Nikki.    Logic goes by the nickname ‘Young Sinatra’ because his mom used to make him watch the legendary Frank Sinatra on TV when he was a child. Logic learned a lot from Mr. Sinatra and decided he wanted to bring that type of class to the hip-hop scene. However, Frank Sinatra was a known and common smoker.

And she and Josh Osborne helped … basically, they wrote the song. I just had the chorus, but they wrote the song, and they even ended up making the chorus a little bit better.

Shelton didn’t write the tune; it was penned by Andy Albert, Marc Beeson and Wyatt Earp, but its lyrics about breaking up with a woman who’d wronged him got people talking in the wake of the singer’s divorce from Miranda Lambert. Many wondered if this was a grenade aimed at his ex.  Jake Owen was also offered the song, as he was going through a marital breakdown around the same time as Blake Shelton. “You’d be so surprised,” Owen told Taste of Country.  When I was going through my divorce everybody – every songwriter, everyone – was sending me songs that were like that. That new song Blake Shelton has out, ‘She’s Got a Way With Words’? That was pitched to me and I remember vividly the first time I heard that, I was like, ‘That’s a really good, cool song, very well written. But if I record this song and I’m taken literally – I don’t want my ex to perceive I did that to her.’  Andy Albert, Marc Beeson and Wyatt Earp put together most of the lyrics by just throwing jokes and phrases at each other, many of which ultimately ended up going into the song. “We’re just laughing over them for two or three hours, and then we started to arrange the different lines and put them together in a way that we thought made some sense,” Albert told Taste of Country.  Shortly after hearing the song, Shelton indicated that he wanted to cut it. He put the tune on hold in the early part of 2015, months before he and Lambert announced their divorce. “Then, unfortunately, he went through all of his personal stuff, the divorce and all of that, and I think the song sort of rang true to him in all that was going on in his life,” Albert said. “I feel like that’s one of the reasons why it made it all the way to the end [of the recording process].”",3,19,50031

The single released on June 3, 2016. The song rocketed up the iTunes charts to number 3 within hours of release, in part, due to Shawn’s #BetteroniTunes drive, encouraging fans to buy it directly from the Apple service.  Lyrically, Mendes sings to his romantic interest, promising to be a better boyfriend than the one she currently has. There was some speculation that this song was about Camila Cabello, the Fifth Harmony member who was rumored to have been dating Mendes in 2016. Both of them, however, insist that they’re just friends.  In Seventeen, Mendes did talk about how he’s matured since his last album, referencing a past relationship:  I have songs about growing up, about ex-relationships—ex-relationship, I should say. I haven’t had relationships. A couple of songs about relationships with girls since fame.  This song’s instrumentation is heavy on guitar. Teddy Geiger and Scott Harris helped pen the lyrics (they were behind two of the major hits on Mendes' previous album Handwritten). Gieger contributed to production alongside Dan Romer, a veteran in the music industry who’s also worked with film, most notably scoring 2011’s Beasts of the Southern Wild.",2,127,1211614

He starts to accept the fact that he may never see this other person again and blames himself for ruining it. The song ends with him asking how to make this person love him.",0,27,246707

Megan first mentioned the song on July 18, 2019, via Twitter:  I feel like it’s only right I drop a hot girl summer song before the summer is over  Two days later, the rapper took to Instagram to tease a short snippet of one of her verses. Eight days after that, a longer snippet and official announcement followed, with Megan stating the track would be dropping on August 2, 2019.  On July 28, 2019, Megan had her first formal conversation with Nicki Minaj, via Instagram Live. Megan teased Nicki about her busy schedule stopping her from getting involved with the song, and hinted that if Nicki could free up her time, there would be a free space on the track.  Following this, on August 1, 2019, Megan took to Twitter to explain that the song’s release date would be delayed by seven days, but would also be “so worth the wait.” This lead to speculation that Nicki Minaj would appear on the track and needed extra time to add her verse.  On August 5, 2019, this theory was confirmed by Megan herself on Instagram:  THE HOT GIRLS TOOK OVER THE MF SUMMER SO IT WAS ONLY RIGHT TO GIVE THE HOTTIES THE OFFICIAL TRACK !!! HOT GIRL SUMMER FT. @nickiminaj and @tydollasign dropping 8/9 🔥🔥🔥🔥  Moments later, Nicki also promoted the song on Instagram. Both women shared the album artwork in their posts.

The song takes the shape of a steady trap beat that features her quintessential lyrics about haters, her lavish lifestyle and her approach to men. Similarly to “B.I.T.C.H” which came before it, Megan samples a hip-hop classic released by a male (in this case Eazy-E) and flips it to the girl version.  Upon the track’s existence being revealed to the public, Eazy-E’s daughters clashed over the sample.

The song reached #1 on Billboard’s Country Songs chart after Stapleton performed it as a duet with Justin Timberlake at the 2015 CMA Awards.  Ironically (given Stapleton’s notoriety as a songwriter), ”Tennessee Whiskey” is a cover of a country classic—it was a minor hit for David Allan Coe in 1981, and a major hit for George Jones in 1983.  Many have also noted the updated arrangement’s resemblance to Etta James' 1968 R&B classic “I’d Rather Go Blind” (a song Beyoncé covered in the 2008 movie Cadillac Records).  Stapleton recalled the cover’s genesis in an interview with Fader:   It’s always been a favorite song of mine. We had a show in Charlottesville, and we were sound checking, waiting around for the mics to get set up. Me and the guys in the band started playing a little bit and got into that groove, so I started thinking, “Man, what song could I sing over top of this?“ For whatever reason, I started singing “Tennessee Whiskey.”  At the time, we had a steel player by the name of Steve Hinson who used to play with George Jones on the road—maybe that was part of the equation.

I didn’t include any songs I’d written with him on Traveller, so it was really important to me … to cut songs from some of the guys who helped me learn how to write songs, and Mike is one of those guys.  Broken Halos is a song about people close to us who pass away. At his concert at the Ryman Auditorium in February 2017, Stapleton introduced the song by noting that he wrote it on the day a childhood friend passed away from pancreatic cancer at the age of 37.

The idea behind the song was inspired by watching a home video of Max and Spencer Ernst (both are band members) jumping on a trampoline.

In a Beats 1 interview, Sam explained that only four songs on the album are about them, and “Too Good at Goodbyes” is one of them. They told Zane Lowe how the song was inspired by a real relationship:  [The song is] about a relationship I was in and it’s basically about getting good at getting dumped.

The song follows lead single “Too Good at Goodbyes”, which dropped just four weeks earlier.  The song combines strong gospel influnces with a hip hop beat, courtesy of Timbaland, who co-produced the song with Jimmy Napes.  Smith told Billboard that “Pray” was inspired by a visit to Iraq:  I spent five days in Mosul and came back ­embarrassed that I had known so little about the world and other people’s lives…I wanted to write about what is going on in the rest of the world, and that it’s not always pretty.  The tone of the lyric is searingly self-critical; a ‘coming-of-age’ song involving feelings of shame, guilt, newly raised awareness, and ultimately some degree of trust in whatever Power they feel might exist.  It is also a markedly intelligent song, indicating Sam’s grasp of the shortcomings and immaturity of many young people, and the shocks and processes that lead to self-growth and a compassionate outlook.  Sam Smith performed the song at the 2018 Grammy Awards.",9,77,905967

Smith explained to MTV News how this was the song that kick-started their music career:  “Disclosure heard ‘Lay Me Down,’ and (after that) it was like a domino effect,” he said. “We wrote ‘Latch’ together, and then Naughty Boy heard ‘Latch’ and we wrote ‘La La La’ together, and then I had a number-one single in the UK.”  The song was re-recorded for a 2015 re-release following Smith’s commercial success. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaMq2nn5ac0",1,93,758232

Sam said that they wanted to move on from heartbreak ballads, commenting in a press release:  This year, both personally and musically, I feel so free. More than ever I have had so much fun making this record and this video…  The song is characterised by a hypnotic beat and danceable rhythm. The melody has features of Sam’s style, notably showcasing their vocal range and the distinctive timbre of their voice. The lyric, however, is of heartache and resentment – a story typical of Sam.  The accompanying music video also marks a departure, in that it features Sam’s considerable dancing skills; an unexpected surprise.",4,67,675415

He said on his social media:  This is one of the highlights of my career. I am honoured to finally announce that I will be singing the next Bond theme song. I am so excited to be a part of this iconic British legacy and join an incredible line up of some of my biggest musical inspirations.  I hope you all enjoy the song as much as I enjoyed making it.  Sam dropped the first major hint that he would be recording the theme song when he shared a snap of him wearing a ring emblazoned with the Spectre logo on 7 September 2015.  https://instagram.com/p/7VWisvR2Vl/  In an interview on the BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show with Nick Grimshaw, he told that he co-wrote the song with long-time collaborator Jimmy Napes in twenty minutes. “It’s the quickest song I’ve ever written. The actual vocal on the song is my demo.” He recorded the song in January 2015.  I wanted to make the most classic, most timeless Bond song and also tried to make it an epic love song. That’s all I’m saying.  Commenting on the announcement, Bond producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said:  Sam and Jimmy have written the most inspirational song for Spectre and with Sam’s extraordinary vocal performance, “Writing’s On The Wall” will surely be considered one of the greatest Bond songs of all time.  Sam Smith is the first British male solo artist to sing the Bond theme since 1965, when Tom Jones performed the task for Thunderball (Paul McCartney and Simon Le Bon also sang vocals for Bond themes, but these were credited as band performances).  The single was an international hit, and became the first Bond theme to hit #1 in the UK.  It won the Oscar for Best Original Song at the 88th Academy Awards in 2016.",5,50,583517

It’s all in good fun, though, as most of the rappers Nicki puts down are friends and collaborators. A few of them are even featured on the album Queen, including Lil Wayne and Swae Lee.  Nicki previously used the “Just Playing (Dreams)” beat on her 2007 track “Dreams” from her mixtape, Playtime Is Over.  In an August 2018 episode of her Beats 1 Queen Radio show with Zane Lowe, Nicki broke down the track, saying:  Reading the reaction to ‘Barbie Dreams’ is hilarious. Everyone is saying how disrespectful [the song] is and that’s why I fucking love it. ‘Barbie Dreams’ is gonna go down in history. Shout outs to B.I.G. you are still inspiring rappers every day. This man is still inspiring me every day. He’s one of the first rappers who had a sense of humor. I love dope writers who can write bars and make you laugh. Eminem [after that] too. I think [humor] shows a person’s IQ and [wittiness].",42,270,2546616

Although the song’s title was originally thought to be related to a popular sexual term from 2015, it mostly references “truffle butter” as a symbol for luxury, with a few lines from Drake and Wayne pointing to the former.  The trio stunts about their lavish lives over a Nineteen85 beat that samples Maya Jane Coles' 2010 song “What They Say.” The song has been compared to the previous Young Money joint single “Only,” another cut from Nicki’s album.",19,187,2330397

The singles were the first songs from her fourth studio album Queen.  Throughout the song, Nicki compares herself to Chun-Li, a martial artist who seeks revenge for the death of her father, by saying she’s one of the first female rappers to dominate the rap game, and still dominates it despite her rivals' efforts to put her down.  Along with these comparisons, the cover art depicts her donning the same hairstyle as the character:    Chun-Li in Street Fighter V.   She also previously referenced both Street Fighter and the character in her verse on 2011’s “Fireball” by Willow Smith, where she raps:  Ok I’m the street fighter, call me Chun-Li",26,260,1942585

The song is a pop ballad produced by Dr. Luke, who first came to fame in 2004 when he produced Kelly Clarkson’s “Since U Been Gone.” Critics have praised the song for its emotional delivery, comparing it to other famous ballads like Celine Dion’s “My Heart Will Go On” and Sinead O'Connor’s “Nothing Compares 2 U.”    The song has been interpreted as a ballad about “love lost and found, but also about—again—the idea of youth burning hard and fast and then fading away.”  The controversial video features a nude Miley swinging on an actual wrecking ball. The singer explains:  The song is a pop ballad that everyone can relate to; everyone has felt that feeling at some point. If people can take their minds off the obvious and go into their imagination and see what the video really means, it is so vulnerable.  The song hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in September 2013, making it Miley’s very first number one single.  It is rumored that the song was initially written for Beyoncé. In December 2012, Sacha Skarbek tweeted, “Beyonce song now becoming a Miley Cyrus song?!! Good/bad? I don’t know??!!!!”",8,141,955476

Like her early hit “Party In The USA”, “We Can’t Stop” is about partying and having a good time. Unlike “Party in the USA”, “We Can’t Stop” is a slower, more bittersweet track, with a little language (the only swear word here used is “hell”), a little sex, and a few drug references. (The producer denies the latter.)  Distancing yourself from Disney takes some work, but this is the moment Miley’s due diligence began in earnest. This track is rife with hip-hop references—part of Miley’s move towards an edgier, new sound.  The song peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100.",14,135,712232

The title refers to the Magnolia Projects, which fits the bouncy New Orleans-inspired production.  In March 2017, Carti previewed the song during his SXSW performance with producer Southside. On March 19, Carti went on Twitter to drop a promotional trailer for his debut mixtape, which featured a segment of the song as a backdrop. Later that day, Carti and Southside played the full song on Instagram Live.  During a June 2017 interview with The Fader, Pi'erre Bourne discussed linking up with Carti and producing the song:  I made [Magnolia] in the car. […] People might not know the whole story going into the songs, but the beats I gave Carti I made day-of or the day before the session. All of March, we were cooking it up.  Since its release, “Magnolia” has received massive acclaim—it debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, and peaked at #29 in July 2017. Moreover, it has been certified 3x platinum by the RIAA.  The official music video dropped on July 10, 2017, featuring footage of Carti on the streets of New York, with cameo appearances from A$AP Rocky, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, and Don Q, among others.",20,220,2420149

The track features the classic hip-hop tropes of money, drugs and women. However, Carti expresses his frustration with the copycat genre throughout the chorus. One such imitator may be Smokepurpp, who copied the vocals and production of Carti’s 2014 single “Smash” in 2016. This song makes it clear that Carti and Uzi consider one and other as pioneers of the late 2010s generation of trap music.  This track marks the fourth released collaboration between Playboi Carti and Philadephia-born rapper Lil Uzi Vert. The song was released as a single along with “Lookin” (which featured Lil Uzi as well) prior to the release of Carti’s debut mixtape Playboi Carti.",17,198,918937

On the track, the trio boast about their luxurious lifestyles; an influx in currency, exotic sport vehicles and excessive use in narcotics.  The original title of the track was “Kobe”, however the professional basketball player Kobe Bryant passed away due to an accidental helicopter crash on January 26, 2020. Out of respect, Taz Taylor later changed the track’s original title from “Kobe” to “Lost Me”.  Due to a problem with the artists and record labels in early 2020, the track was originally scrapped from the album as Taz Taylor explained in a tweet.  On April 21, 2020, all of the artists and labels reunited as iann dior confirmed the track was releasing soon. The track was confirmed to be featured on the collective Internet Money album, B4THESTORM.

The track is directed at her ex G-Eazy after she was “cheated on in front of the entire world, like, a billion times.”  This song dives into the personal feelings of Halsey after being a very public relationship. The track is different to her earlier conceptual records Badlands and hopeless fountain kingdom, due to the fact there was no role to play:  It’s the most raw thing I’ve ever made… Here, I have this record where it’s just me, no character. It’s about my life and my relationship that the world has watched so closely… It’s just me.  The song premiered on Zane Lowe’s “World Record” on Beats 1 Radio, and was followed by an interview with the artist about “Without Me”.  In that interview, Halsey stated that the song was not going to be part of a future album, and described it as a “stand-alone record;” however, on 13 September 2019, “Without Me” was revealed to be track 9 on her third studio album Manic.  In honor of the song hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Halsey released a remix of the track featuring Juice WRLD.",8,202,2131030

The context behind family and addictions provides evidence that “Colors” is about The 1975’s frontman Matty Healy.  In October of 2015, Halsey mentioned during one of her shows that her and Matty met at that particular venue. She has also mentioned him as an inspiring influence. Billboard brought him up in an interview, questioning the nature of their relationship, to which she responded:  We’re both attracted to characters, and we saw that in each other. I spent a lot of time watching him and he spent a lot of time loving being watched. But if you think he’s the first red-wine-drinking, pretty-boy rocker in skinny jeans I’ve … been associated with, you’re out of your fucking mind.  Halsey posted images of Healy on her Instagram, as well as a personal post on her (now deleted) personal Tumblr in July of 2014 about her sentiments towards their relationship.  Despite the depth of information provided, the two are not explicitly confirmed to have been a legitimate couple. At the time, Halsey was in a relationship with Norwegian hip-hop artist and producer Lido, who worked extensively on many tracks from Badlands and went on to produce many songs in her discography.  “Colors” was the second single from Halsey’s debut Badlands, announced through a mural in Brooklyn, NY in January of 2016. The official music video features MTV’s Teen Wolf star Tyler Posey and tells a tale of unrequited love.",14,134,1265820

Despite “Without Me” featuring on Halsey’s third LP, “Nightmare” is a stand-alone record.  Lyrically, the track acts as a follow-up to “Devil In Me,” a track  from 2017 album hopeless fountain kingdom, which discusses Halsey’s passive past.  The track was officially announced following her show at Webster Hall in honor of previous album hopeless fountain kingdom. Around this time, Halsey added a new website to her social media bios, dedicated to the interpretation of nightmares.",8,116,901428

It is a very deep track from the beauty of Halsey’s heart. In the song, Halsey laments about the insecurities she felt, and how it was a part of her relationship. Her insecurities made her push her lover away, and she worries if she will ever be able to let anyone close to her again. Throughout the song, Halsey also hints at how her Bipolar Disorder might be the reason she failed at her relationships.  On February 1st 2018, she tweeted that she’s got a surprise for the fans. https://twitter.com/halsey/status/959225539595784193 The next day, on February 2nd 2018, she unexpectedly released a music video for Sorry.

The track shares similarities with October 2018 single “Without Me,” about ex-boyfriend G-Eazy and his infidelity. In a tweet following the release of “You should be sad” Halsey hinted that the song was also about G-Eazy, whilst explaining the concept behind the music video:  Had the vision to do a “before he cheats” but instead about after he does haha.  The track’s single release was first hinted at in November 2019, after it appeared on her Spotify. At the time, it was suspected to be the album’s fourth installment, but was preceded by December 2019 promotional singles,  “Finally // beautiful Stranger” and “Suga’s Interlude.”",6,88,833680

It became an international success, reaching #1 in five countries and peaking at #9 in the United States. Seventeen years after its initial release, “Bohemian Rhapsody” re-entered the pop charts in the US, peaking at #2 after being featured in the 1992 hit movie Wayne’s World. In 2002, the song was listed at #1 in a Guinness World Records poll as Britain’s favourite single of all time—ranking higher than four Beatles tracks and “Imagine” by John Lennon.  Complex and operatic both musically and lyrically, “Bohemian Rhapsody” (like Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven” and The Eagles‘ “Hotel California”) has attracted endless fan theories and commentary. The surviving band members have claimed that the narrative is based on the Faust legend; critics have found possible sources in opera and Freddie Mercury’s personal biography; but like any good piece of art, it’s open to interpretation.  The word “Bohemian” seems to refer to a group of artists and musicians from the 19th century, known for defying convention and living with disregard for standards; as opposed to the region of Bohemia in the Czech Republic. Meanwhile the term “rhapsody” (derived from the Greek: ῥαψῳδός or rhapsōidos for a reciter of epic poetry, or a rhapsodist) is a piece of classical music with distinct sections that are played as one movement. Rhapsodies often feature dense themes or narratives.  As of December 2018, “Bohemian Rhapsody” is the most streamed song of the 20th century.  “Bohemian Rhapsody” has got a very diverse song structure. It includes: • Intro (0:00-0:49) • Ballad section (0:49-2:37) • Brian May‘s’ guitar solo (2:37-3:05) • Operatic verse (3:05-4:07) • Hard-rock verse (4:07-4:54) • Coda (4:54-5:55)",21,414,8907304

It’s a simple song, an energetic song that sees lead singer Freddie Mercury on a high that he wants to stay in, letting nobody pull him down.  Critically, the song performed well, releasing as a single after the release of album Jazz. Despite reaching number 9 on the UK charts and later going Platinum, it only hit 86 on the US charts. Time has only increased its popularity, as it is often included in “Greatest Hit” compilations and stands as their second most played song on Spotify with over 750 million plays as of January 2020.",8,118,1075347

You wanna try . ","“Killer Queen” was the breakthrough song that turned Queen into worldwide rock stars. Peaking at #2 in the UK, the song became a hit in seven other European countries as well. “Killer Queen” was the first Queen single to successfully ‘cross the pond’, becoming a top 20 hit in the U.S. and Canada, as well as a top 30 hit in Australia.  In the New Musical Express of November 2, 1974, the song’s writer and Queen’s frontman Freddie Mercury elucidates on this song: “It’s about a high class call girl. I’m trying to say that classy people can be whores as well. That’s what the song is about, though I’d prefer people to put their interpretation upon it – to read into it what they like.”  While it may seem like a typical popular song, the structure utilised in the song is quite unusual. There are 4 bar phrases immediately followed by 5 bar phrases and then 2 bar phrases, with tempo changing from 12/8 to 6/8 and vice versa.  The main key being Eb major is very unorthodox for Rock music, as guitars don’t usually play flats. Brian May, who pioneered a heavier hard rock sound, had been struck with hepatitis during the majority of the recording. Upon initially hearing the song, Brian was shocked over the more progressive, lighter sound. Nevertheless, the rest of the band left space for Brian to record his own iconic guitar melodies.  The song includes prominent uses of multi-tracking, not just on the vocals, but also in the guitar solo. Other effects used include the flanger (pitch bends), panning (sound moving from the left ear to the right), portamento/glissando (sliding from one note to another), distortion (giving a creamy feel), wah-wah on the guitar, string bending and sliding.  The band had decided not to use the ubiquitous synthesiser, as they thought it was superfluous. Instead, instrumentation utilised includes a jangle piano (detuned), drum kit, bass guitar, electric guitar and vocals.",14,120,783264

The song became a hit in 17 countries, but nowhere larger than in the United States, where it became the biggest-selling Queen record ever, topping both the Pop and Disco charts, as well as reaching #2 on the Soul chart.  Composed by bassist John Deacon, the song features an instantly recognizable funk bass riff, and high energy, bordering on manic, vocals by Freddie Mercury.  According to Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic, this surprise crossover hit was responsible for a change in the band’s musical style.  [The success] pushed the members of Queen into some questionable musical decisions in the near future. The most blatant and negative of these was their decision to commit the bulk of their next effort, 1982’s Hot Space, to experimental, dancey funk and electrified soul – a catastrophic move which alienated many longtime fans and effectively killed the band’s career in America. Lucky for them, the rest of the world wasn’t as unforgiving and quickly embraced Queen once again when they retreated to somewhat more familiar (though no less eclectic) hard rock territory with 1984’s The Works.",14,99,736645

It was a conscious decision by Brian May to make the song simple and anthemic (“stomp, stomp, clap, pause” twice per 4/4 measure), to get their live audiences more involved in their shows.    Queen also recorded a guitar-driven, punk-influenced “fast version” of the song with John Peel in 1977 that was often performed live.  In the video for “We Will Rock You” and “Spread Your Wings”, May used a copy of his guitar. He supposedly did not want to commit his Red Special to outside conditions, as the videos for these songs featured the band performing in the snow in Roger Taylor’s garden.",11,107,685736

Its music video prominently features footage from the iconic German Sci-Fi movie Metropolis.  The band performed this song, among others, during the 1985 Live Aid at Wembley Stadium in London; Queen’s set is considered to be one of the most pivotal moments in the history of rock ‘n’ roll. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0omja1ivpx0  The original title of this song was “Radio Ca-Ca”.

The Bronx rapper drops bars woven between Bruno’s crooning over a 90’s style beat. The original track was released on Bruno’s 2016 album 24K Magic, which spawned three Hot 100 singles. With his throwback star power and Cardi’s fire bars, the track is destined for success as well.  On Instagram, Bruno revealed how “the one and only” Cardi’s verse came to be and gave her some advice:  I met Cardi B at 3 am after my show in LA backstage where we recorded her verse for Finesse. She walked in the room and she was everything I’d hope she’d be. Never change cardi! Don’t let this crazy music business change who you are. You posses something that can’t be taught. You’re a true star. Thank you for putting your energy and love all over this record and video.  Cardi has recently collaborated with many artists, accumulating millions of streams and breaking records along the way, so it’s likely that this remix will be another addition to her successes. She went to Instagram to convey her gratitude.  The song debuted in the #35 spot and then jumped up to #3 the following week on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart.  They performed during the 60th Grammy Awards on January 28th, 2018, mashed up with a verse of Cardi B’s “Bartier Cardi.”",8,163,2565794

The song was released as the second single from the album following the lead single “Chains”.  Jonas has described the song as a song about when someone is checking out your girl and you’re out, and it’s that whole experience I think a lot of men relate to, but don’t actually talk about.  The time and place in which he was writing and recording this song also played an interesting role, as he was training for Kingdom. It’s pretty safe to imply that he was “hyped up on testosterone” while writing it.",4,74,383232

He tweeted about his creative conceit for the song the day before it dropped:  https://twitter.com/nickjonas/status/712911546947649536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw  This track and its sultry music video show Nick’s moving past the squeaky clean image of his Jonas Brothers days. For the first time in Nick’s highly regulated celebrity life, he’s solo. Besides experiencing the biggest break up of his life, he’s been the subject of celebrity gossip, played a gay MMA fighter on a TV show, and announced his own record label with his BFF, Demi Lovato. He’s stepping into adulthood and new artistic territory, and this song represents a step further in that trajectory.  Nick Jonas and Swedish singer-songwriter Tove Lo were friends. After performing at the Jingle Ball, Nick reached out and she hopped on the song. Tove told EW:  I’ve known Nick as a friend for a couple of years, and working with him was amazing. He’s very talented and I fell in love with the song as soon as I heard the demo.  This track has a roster of veteran pop-makers including songwriting credits from Tove,  Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter, and Swedish production duo Mattman and Robin (who also produced the track).  On March 21st, Nick sent out a video teaser for the song. The official video for the song was released on March 25, 2016. Describing it to Ryan Seacrest, he said: “I actually was just texting Tove—look, there’s gonna be some babies made to this song and they better be named after us.”",6,46,185959

Another source spoke a different meaning of the track, saying it’s not just about love, but the burden of fame as well:  Nick has spent years experiencing a burden that’s hard to explain. He’s not blaming anyone for it; it’s just what fame does to people, especially at a young age.",3,43,82136

It was released a week after the first promotional single, “The Heart Part 4,” with a music video directed by Dave Meyers and The Little Homies. It features religious imagery mixed with urban life, such as Kendrick in priest’s robes and a moving re-enactment of Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting The Last Supper—juxtaposing this with the concept of humility in the chorus.  On a religious note, the song could also be a reference to the verse James 4:7.  So humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.""  —Thus linking to April 7th, the date Kendrick told the industry to have their shit together.  Mike WiLL Made-It produced the beat. It features a deep piano riff and a banging 808 bass line. This style of production is a departure from the sound of Kendrick’s previous jazz-influenced project, To Pimp a Butterfly. It seems to reference the character Deebo’s theme song from the popular comedy movie Friday (1995). Kendrick is also shown riding through the neighborhood on a bicycle in the music video, similar to Deebo in Friday.  The song debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 on April 22, 2017, making it not only the highest charting song for Kendrick, but also one of the highest debuting hip-hop singles since “Love the Way You Lie” by Eminem. The song later hit No. 1 on the chart on June 5, 2017, making it Lamar’s first No. 1 song and second No. 1 song overall on the charts.",19,949,10922769

Kendrick’s recent beat-down brings back early memories of similar situations, witnessing someone with their brains blown out at a burger stand back when he was 9 (probably referring to his Uncle Tony, or someone in a similar situation), he thinks he knows the person who did it but he censors their name. He also talks about how his cousin was killed back in ‘94.  He talks about his father telling him to get a job but he’s fired after his friends pressure him into staging a robbery. He gives his reason for why he doesn’t smoke when he tells a story of smoking marijuana laced with cocaine and “foaming at the mouth.”  In the final verse he tries to let the good shine through and offer respite for the youth and how they don’t have to succumb to the temptations and pressures of the street. He hopes that his experience and intelligence can do good for the youth living in similar situations.",80,659,6695420

What sounds like a club anthem is actually an introspective take on the social pressure and self-defeating attitudes that drive people to drink.  The theme of swimming in pools as a metaphor for drinking and alcoholism could be a reference to the 1964 short story “The Swimmer” by author John Cheever.  K-Dot spoke to Complex about the inspiration behind this song:  What better way to make something universal than to speak about drinking? I’m coming from a household where you had to make a decision—you were either a casual drinker or you were a drunk. That’s what that record is really about, me experiencing that as a kid and making my own decisions.  The radio version of “Swimming Pools (Drank)” ends here.",44,436,6021972

In the music video, Kendrick and actor Don Cheadle appear to trade bars, engaging in an argument using the song’s lyrics during an interrogation scene. We also learn that “DNA” stands for “Dead Nigger Association.”  Lamar is wearing a traditional Kung Fu uniform throughout the piece. In an interview with Pitchfork, Don Cheadle confirmed that he inadvertently inspired the ‘Kung Fu Kenny’ persona. Cheadle portrayed a Chinese-speaking martial artist named Kenny in the 2001 action-comedy sequel Rush Hour 2.    At the beginning of the video, the song “YAH.” can be heard echoing above—almost as if it is playing in Kendrick’s head as the camera pans down. “YAH.” comes directly after “DNA.” on DAMN.’s tracklist.  Following his initial encounter with Cheadle, who seems to be portraying a law enforcement figure, the ending of “BLOOD.” suddenly begins playing; when Cheadle turns on the lie-detector device, he begins convulsing, almost as if in a trance. This snippet comes from the video of Geraldo Rivera criticizing Kendrick’s lyrics on “Alright,” one of his most successful singles. The music video also contains snippets from “Hood Politics,” another song from Lamar’s March 2015 award-winning album, To Pimp A Butterfly.  Lastly, the song’s second verse samples a different segment of the same Fox News clip from “BLOOD.” and it’s worth noting that “BLOOD.” precedes “DNA.” on the album.",36,599,5708248

He talks about robbing the house, “Home invasion was persuasive/From 9 to 5 I know its vacant.” He mentions fucking Sherane and bragging about it to his homies, “I fucked Sherane then went to tell my bros.” He references “Backseat Freestyle” when he talks about rhyming to beats, “Park the car then we started rhyming, ya bish/The only thing we had to free our mind.” And he talks about jumping dudes who looked like they had more money than them, “Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs/You looking like an easy come up ya bish/A silver spoon I know you come from ya bish."" The line in the chorus “Everybody gon' respect the shooter/But the one in front of the gun lives forever.” is deeply important, not just as a life motto, but in regards to the events that later take place in this story regarding Dave and his brother. It’s also a reference to Kendrick’s Uncle Tony, who was shot and killed at Louie’s Burgers; this event is a snap back to reality from the “dreams of living life like rappers do.”  A sequel to this song, titled “Money Trees Deuce,” was released on Jay Rock’s 2015 album, 90059.",43,469,5351480

In an interview with Rolling Stone, Kendrick described how this song came together:  We had a [different] record we were supposed to be doing together. He sent it over, I laid some ideas to it, and we didn’t know where it was going. I just happened to have an album coming out, so I just asked him, like, “Yo, would you do me this honor of letting me use this record, use this idea that I want to put together because I’m hearing a certain type of 808, a certain drum to it.” And he was open to it.  This song seems to be a transitional moment in the album. Going with the original album play-through or the backwards play theory, In his path of wickedness, Kendrick begins to question the hypocratic ways of America after setting aside his Godly ways and overcoming fear. However, on his path to weakness, Kendrick continues on after “LOVE,” where he expresses his feeling towards that special woman, and on this track, Kendrick expresses what he would do to protect his woman as well as his immediate family and having the will to kill if necessary, before he succumbs to fear and giving his life to God.  In the first verse, Kendrick begins by addressing moral ambiguity, noting that even the best of us are capable of evil if the conditions are right. Kendrick brags about his accomplishments on the streets before a friend calls him for advice on the devastating death of his son—the usually-meditative Kendrick pushes him to take violent revenge.  The second verse provides the worldly context for this violence, continuing the nihilistic themes from “PRIDE.”  The appearance of U2 on “XXX” raised eyebrows when the tracklist to DAMN. dropped since U2 is well past its popular zenith, but the song has been well received since.  In an excellent piece of criticism, Steven Hyden notes that the lyrics of “XXX” grapple with spiritual dislocation in America in Old Testament overtones—something U2 has been doing for three decades.  It’s also worth noting that Nardwuar the Human Serviette unintentionally predicted this collaboration back in March of 2012 (before GKMC’s release) when he interviewed Kendrick at the SXSW Festival in Austin, TX. Watch his response when asked if he would ever like to have a sleepover with Bono:  https://youtu.be/6s5vlQdQp4s?t=10m27s  YouTuber Justin Hunte goes into depth in this video about Kendrick’s “XXX” repping for the entire millenial generation. He breaks down how the last verse of the song calls out America for its hyprocrisy in these lines:  You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera America’s reflections of me, that’s what a mirror does",24,408,4965780

Come on, we finna roll out! Nigga, I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD Get yo' freestyles ready!","The content of this song doesn’t advance the narrative of the album. It is told from the perspective of present-day Kendrick Lamar, who isn’t happy with the state of rap music, and strives to be different by maintaining his vision. He also discusses his career so far and how it has changed his life, for better or worse.  Kendrick explained this song in an interview with Complex saying:  That’s really one big subliminal at everybody getting mixed in a situation where everyone wants to have creative control. That’s the vibe I wanted to kill. That’s why I threw that record out. If you listen to some of the words, it’s real intricate, but it makes sense.  This song samples Danish electronic group Boom Clap Bachelors’ 2008 tune “Tiden Flyver.”  Originally this song was supposed to feature Lady Gaga. After the song was officially released, Gaga posted the original version on Twitter. Kendrick explained to Complex why Gaga didn’t make the album saying:  “We had to meet the deadline for the pre-order date. That’s just the business side coming through and messing things up.”  Gaga was also supposed to work on Kendrick on the song “Partynauseous,” but that was never released either. The female vocals on the song are instead performed by Anna Wise.",33,427,4791747

RM explained that the song was inspired by Obama’s speech at the 2016 White House Correspondent’s Dinner.  The action of dropping a mic after a speech or a statement soon became a symbol of one’s confidence and “swag”.  RM expressed that their song “Mic Drop” aims to do exactly that.  RM also explains the whole concept behind the song (along with the rest of the songs in the album) in the Love Yourself Her Behind The Scenes V LIVE Broadcast. Skip to 28:23.,7,80,1045769

Similar to how different flowers can mean different things, the smeraldo means “the truth I couldn’t tell,” according to the only flower shop that claims to sell it.    There are similarities between the lyrics of the song and “La Città di Smeraldo”, an Italian tale about a man who hides in his house because he’s afraid of showing himself. As he watches from the window, he falls in love with a woman stealing flowers from his garden to sell them. Trying to help her, he grows a special flower, the smeraldo, so that she can earn more money from it, but the woman dies before she is able to see it or meet the man. Several quotes from the original story are written in the teaser posters for the Love Yourself series.",5,84,986520

The song gives a positive light over a friend’s absence, utilizing a seasonal metaphor to deliberate on how things will get better afterward.  Although essentially alternative hip-hop, BTS member J-Hope described the song as “a mix of Brit rock and electronic sounds”.  The official music video (MV) was released on YouTube at midnight, February 12, 2017. It was the most viewed video on YouTube that day, and broke the record for most-watched music video by any k-pop group on the day of release, surpassing 11.8 million views during 24 hours. In the following weeks, it also set records for being the fastest K-pop group MV to reach 10 million, 20 million, and 30 million views.  YNWA was released at midnight on February 13, 2017 (KST). For the first two hours after release, “Spring Day” scored a “roof hit” on Korea’s largest music streaming service, Melon. It was the first-ever roof hit for BTS. (A “roof hit” occurs when a song’s downloads and streams place it so far ahead in the first place that it pushes the charting graph Melon uses to track performance to a new high and maintains that pace for at least one hour.)    It remained at number one on Melon for 23 hours, at the time, the longest any BTS song had stayed at number one.  “Spring Day” went on to achieve an all-kill, meaning it ranked #1 on all eight real-time Korean music charts.  The song hit #1 on the major music charts of 14 countries and placed in Spotify’s Viral 50 in 12 countries, including the US. It debuted on Billboard’s Bubbling Under Hot 100 Chart at No. 15 and was the first song by a K-pop group to reach the top 10 on US iTunes. The MV was also the most popular music video in the US iTunes store.  “Spring Day” was nominated for 6 awards during the 2017 end of year awards season. It won Best Music Video (MAMA), Digital Bonsang (GDA), Weekly Popularity Award (MMA), and a daesang (“grand prize”) for Best Song of the Year (MMA).  One year after its initial release, Spring Day continued to chart in the top 50 songs on Melon.  Spring day was J-Hope’s 1st song singing without rapping.  A lot of fans from BTS’s Fanbase known as A.R.M.Y. had created a theory-based of a tragedy in South Korea not too long ago known as the Sinking of the MV Sewol where the Japanese-built South Korean ferry sank while carrying 476 people, mostly from Danwon High school. In total, 304 passengers and crew members died in the disaster.  https://youtu.be/dhME_nj5CWc  “Spring day” seems likely to be a tribute to the Sewol Ferry tragedy. Though not the complete song but one part is dedicated to that.  There are no official confirmations from BTS themselves on saying that “Spring Day” was actually about the Sewol ferry tragedy as BTS wished to leave the interpretation of the songs and MV to the viewers as they mentioned during their Wings Tour in Seoul Press conference.",10,91,944308

Featuring acoustic guitars, synthesizers, and autotune effects, this song highlights a new sonic direction for BTS. The song was released on September 18, 2017 in South Korea, and landed on Billboard’s “100 best songs of 2017”, being the only Korean artists on that list. They landed on another Billboard list in 2018 at the 49th spot, the list being “100 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time”  The lyrics can be read as a loose continuation of “Intro: Serendipity” where we see the flow of science references extended into this song.  Critics received the song very well. In the United States, Vulture’s Dee Lockett stated, “‘DNA’ is one of the better singles of the year,” upon the song’s release. In terms of sales, they were ranked thirty-seventh in the U.S. The song also made impacts on the Spotify Platform, being the first ever Kpop Act to enter the ‘Global Top 50’ playlist. In the domestic promotions of ‘DNA’ back in South Korea, BTS won 1st place 10 times on multiple music shows.  DNA’s successful performance in the USA also snatched the group a chance to perform at the AMAs, marking their American Television Debut. On November 30, BTS was invited to The Late Late Show with James Corden, being the first Kpop act to ever do so. ‘DNA’ and the Love Yourself 承 ‘Her’ album together marked BTS’s breakthrough into the American mainstream music industry.  “DNA” recently reached 700 million views on YouTube.

In the track, Tones sings about the struggles of being a musical performer, inspired by her experiences as a busker. She explained to Billboard:  It’s a song about a moment where I felt frustrated about how people had no patience anymore. […] If you replace the word ‘dance’ with ‘sing,’ it’s pretty self-explanatory. I’ve literally turned quotes that people say to me into lyrics – they’re all very real. […] It was one night where people just wouldn’t let me be. I’d been busking for seven or eight hours, and I had done six encores. So many people get inspired in the moment and just make up bullshit to try to give you hope. Every person swears black and blue on their kids’ lives that they’re someone and they can help me and they never do.  “Dance Monkey” was written in October 2018, at her manager’s house. Tones posted a video of herself performing the track the day she wrote it.",1,148,2182856

A rhythm is given by xylophones, guitars, and percussions. The style and rhythm have been noted as close to the  Sia successes, “Cheap Thrills”, which has caused some controversy. Ed has denied receiving inspiration from the track. Just like “Cheap Thrills”, however, “Shape of You” was written with the intention of it being recorded by Rihanna, but Sheeran later decided to keep it for himself.  In the song, Sheeran sings about meeting someone at a bar and falling in love with her; a love distinct from those in much of his previous work as it’s more focused on the physical than the emotional.  Sheeran had teased the song through a tweet that he had posted on January 5, 2017. The video had a colon that would then merge into a human body, referencing the “body”-inspiration of the song.  As of August 29, 2017, “Shape Of You” set a Billboard record, spending 33 straight weeks in the Top 10 of the Hot 100 chart.  On September 22, 2017, the track became the most streamed song of all time on the Spotify plaform at 1.318 billion plays. Sheeran passed Drake who previously held the record with “One Dance.”  The song won a Grammy Best Pop Solo Performance at the 2018 Grammys held on January 28, 2018.  On January 24th, 2019, “Shape Of You” was certified Diamond by the RIAA, selling over ten million units.",9,311,14392022

It is the fourth single from Sheeran’s 2017 album ÷.  He explained his motivation for writing “Perfect” in an interview with Music Choice:  I think the song “Perfect” is actually better than “Thinking Out Loud.” I think there was always a scare that “Thinking Out Loud” would define me and define my career. So I, I wrote a lot of songs trying to beat it and now I think, I think I have beaten it.  Thematically, the song is reminiscent of “18,” a song he wrote for his friends in One Direction.  The “Perfect Duet” featuring Beyoncé was released on Dec. 1, 2017 and the “Perfect Symphony” with Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli came out two weeks later on Dec. 15.  The song reached number one on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart.",8,340,5993031

Ed Sheeran told interviewers the following about the production of the song:  It was written for my mom’s point of view. My grandmother was very ill during the time I was making the record and passed away at the end of me making the record so we wrote this song as a tribute and just left it on.  Ed admitted he initially didn’t want to put it on the record at all, and it was his grandfather who convinced him to do it:  My grandfather just turned to me [at the funeral], he was like you have to put that out, that has to go on the record.

Though he was just 23 when he wrote it, he imagines the love lasting well into his later years.  The message resonated with fans, and it shattered several records—it was the first song to spend a full year in the UK Top 40, and the first song to reach 500 million streams on Spotify (the service also deemed it the top “first dance” song in the world).   Sheeran wrote the song about his then-girlfriend Athina Andrelos. He calls it the only happy song on the album x, on which he strived for a more serious vibe, working extensively with Rick Rubin.  Sheeran co-wrote “Thinking Out Loud” with Welsh folk singer Amy Wadge, and his friend and long-time collaborator Jake Gosling produced the track. Chris Leonard engineered it, and played guitar.  The bass and drums are very close to Marvin Gaye’s “Let’s Get It On""—Sheeran has even mixed a little of the ""Let’s Get It On” lyrics into his life performances:  https://youtu.be/RxZjVZKVN7k?t=4m29s",8,174,1688503

The lyrics depict a man and woman meeting in an Irish pub and dancing and singing the night away.  In his interview for the cover story of GQ’s March 2017 issue, Sheeran explained he had to fight to keep “Galway Girl” on the album. The influence of Van Morrison’s Irish Heartbeat is clear, and Ed believes it will be “fucking massive.”  The term “Galway Girl” describes a black haired and blue eyed woman from the city of Galway and it was coined by Steve Earle’s song of the same title.  The track features award-winning Irish folk band Beoga as co-writers and musicians. He told Irish radio:  I’ve actually got a song on the new album which I think is really gonna explode in Ireland. It would be something to do with the county of Galway. I’ve got a trad band called Beoga, they’re actually from Belfast. It’s a fiddle, a pipe, a bodhran and piano and we really jam. It’s gonna be really good but I think I will never be able to play another song in Ireland again because that one will just be the song.  In an Track x Track interview with Zane Lowe, Sheeran talked about the process of making the song:  I came up with this song with Foy [Vance], Johnny [McDaid] and Amy [Wadge]. We were recording in Suffolk and we had Beoga, this lrish folk band, come and record some other songs. They have a song called “Minute 5.“ I just said: ""Can you try that on it?” They did and it sounded brilliant so we just kept it.",9,102,1616245
