Along the way, he references real events in rock history, name-drops Bon Scott and Jim Morrison, and highlights rockstar traditions like throwing TVs out of hotel windows.  Post previewed the song in December 2016, nine months before he released it, by posting a video of himself jamming to it in the studio. The preview received thousands of retweets on Twitter over the course of the year, so the track was highly anticipated by the time it finally dropped.  In late December of 2017, it was also revealed that Joey Bada$$ had co-written the track as well as penning an extra verse after Music Mafia leaked the original version of the song. This version also contained a verse from T-Pain, which he confirmed, in place of the 21 Savage’s contributions that ultimately appeared on the final version of the song.  On January 9, 2018, “rockstar” broke the record for holding the number one spot on Spotify’s Global chart with 108 days spent on the top of the list. The previous record holder was Ed Sheeran’s “Shape Of You.”",18.0,438.0,6859347.0

In an interview with XXL, Malone said the track’s success was unexpected:  When I wrote it, I didn’t know that people [were] gonna fuck with it as much as I did. I didn’t plan on releasing it any time soon either, but it leaked somewhere and we just said ‘fuck it’ and recorded it.  Allen Iverson was heralded as one of the greatest players of his time. In his prime, he was considered one of the best players in the NBA, as reflected by his winning of the Most Valuable Player award in 2001.  Post explained his stage name at the Breakfast Club: Post is his real last name, and he made up the Malone part for practically no reason. However, Post has also said he got the idea for his stage name by entering his real name, Austin Post, into a rap name generator.",31.0,221.0,4134800.0

Recruiting Ty Dolla $ign, the two sing about the luxuries they have earned such as convertibles, Audemars Piguet wristwatches, and other expensive jewelry. Post often raps about jewelry, and has posted on Quora to explain what drives him to do so:  When I was a little kid, I would rap about stuff that I wanted, like, “Hey, I’m working my ass off and I want this stuff in the future.” Because you’re not being braggadocious, but you’re still cool because you know what all this stuff is.  Post initially teased the song on January 4, 2017; over a year before its eventual release. Similar to how “rockstar” was teased, Post can be seen vibing to the song in the studio with a beer and a cigarette in hand. The track’s release date was announced when Post revealed he would tour North America in 2018.  “Psycho” debuted at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, matching “rockstar” for Post Malone’s best debut on the Hot 100. Psycho’s debut at #2 also made Post Malone the ninth artist ever, and the second rapper, to have more than one song debut in the top 2 of the Billboard Hot 100. The song eventually peaked at #1 on June 11, 2018, marking Post’s second chart-topping song of his career and the first for Ty.",21.0,231.0,3044653.0

On the release date of the song, Abel posted an Instagram picture with the caption “r.i.p ‘@abelxo,’” marking the turn of his character and sound.

In particular, DaBaby juxtaposes his poor upbringing with the newfound success he experiences, while also looking back on how he changed along the way.  This song was released in dedication of his deceased father and his grandmother, who untimely passed away during his come-up in the rap game. The “INTRO” is an unusual track from DaBaby, as it features hard-hitting lyricism and introspective bars, straying from his typical subject matter.  This track serves as the first promotional single for KIRK, which is unorthodox since rappers typically don’t release introduction tracks on albums as solo songs.",11.0,76.0,407283.0

Being who he is in the industry, he knows that people want him to fail; however, God won’t let him do that.  Another key subject of the song is the separation Drake feels that he needs to have from those outside of his inner circle. Anyone who tries to work their way into his life must have an ulterior motive to benefit themselves.  The last key subject of this song is the fact that Drake is giving back to the life he had once, honoring the people and the environment he also once was in.  The official music video shared a different sentiment though, as Drake took the budget for the video, a whopping $996,631.90, and gave it away to families, schools, charities, and more. It was directed by Karena Evans, who also hails from Toronto, and is a protégé of Director X.  Director X has had a hand in a number of Drake music videos in the past, including “Hotline Bling” and “Started From The Bottom.”",19.0,594.0,8808080.0

The track rides on Drake’s heartfelt singing and honest lyrics, wondering if they still love him.  The track is produced by 40, TrapMoneyBenny and BlaqNmilD. BlaqNmilD had a hand at producing another track on Scorpion, “Nice for What,” which has similar New Orleans bounce influences.  The track is heavily based on vocal samples, a staple of New Orleans bounce. One included sample is Magnolia Shorty’s “Smoking Gun,” and City Girls  vocals are written to sound similar to that track. Also sampled is Lil Wayne’s “Lollipop.”  At the end of the song, Drake samples the seventh episode of the second season of popular TV show Atlanta, which is written, directed, and acted in by Donald Glover a.k.a Childish Gambino. This episode revolved around Drake and was aptly titled “Champagne Papi,” his Instagram username and producer alter-ego.  Days following the album’s release, “In My Feelings” garnered widespread media attention due to a viral video of comedian and Instagram personality, Shiggy, dancing to the song’s hook. The video evolved into the #DoTheShiggy challenge where people would try to replicate Shiggy’s original video. The challenge contributed to “In My Feelings” topping the Billboard Hot 100.  The music video for “In My Feelings” was released on August 2, 2018, starring Drake, Phylicia Rashad, La La Anthony, Shiggy, and Capito & Marley.",13.0,343.0,7261625.0

She’s had an on and off relationship with the 6 God a few times, and her Instagram account is a constant reminder that she’s never home – always traveling to exotic places, and out wearing almost nothing. Based on the lyrics, it’s as if Drake wrote this song while scrolling through her Instagram page.  This song premiered alongside “Charged Up,” “Right Hand,” and material from other OVO artists on OVO Sound Radio Episode 2.  It reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Drake’s then highest peaking single as a lead artist, only to be replaced by the Views single “One Dance” which peaked at #1.  The song heavily samples the song “Why Can’t We Live Together” by Timmy Thomas and has been remixed/covered by a seemingly ever-growing number of Drake’s peers, including Justin Bieber, Erykah Badu, Disclosure/Sam Smith, and Sufjan Stevens.  The official music video was released on October 19th via Apple Music, and was immediately made into a source of various memes involving Drake’s dancing. The song and choreography received much attention that Drake got to perform a segment of the infamous dance in a T-Mobile commercial that aired during Super Bowl 50.",9.0,289.0,6745085.0

Lucid dreaming refers to a state of consciousness where a person is aware they are dreaming. With enough experience, a dreamer can slowly begin to control the contents of their dreams. Juice uses the idea of controlling a lucid dream as an analogy for his mental state; to avoid the pain of seeing his ex-lover in his dreams, Juice seeks to replace them—for good.  Juice’s frequent collaborator, Nick Mira, handles the production of this track. The melody of this track samples the intro of Sting’s March 1993 track “Shape Of My Heart.”  During the week ending October 6, 2018, the track peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.",9.0,466.0,4408320.0

What began as recreational drug use morphed into an addiction that ultimately led to his early death at the tender age of 21. Juice seemingly predicted his own demise on his June 2018 tribute to XXXTENTACION and Lil Peep, who also died young:  What’s the 27 Club? We ain’t making it past 21  On December 8, 2019, Juice WRLD suffered an accidental overdose at Midway International Airport in Chicago. He reportedly swallowed multiple pills after law enforcement attempted to intercept his crew upon suspicion of gun and drug possession. The Cook County Medical Examiner confirmed that fatal levels of codeine and oxycodone were present in his body—the latter of which is found in Percocet, or “Perky,” as it is called in the song’s chorus.",11.0,177.0,1558057.0

The song was made in response to the passing of XXXTENTACION on June 18, 2018.  Juice WRLD previewed this song on his Instagram live the same day he dropped it. As shown by the timeline of events, Juice created this entire song in just under a day.  In the song, Juice analyzes on the current state of the world through what he perceives as confusing and dark. He also talks about how unexpected X’s death was and resurfaced the event of Lil Peep’s death on November 15, 2017.  Additionally, he struggles with the idea of becoming a legend himself and questions how fame will impact his well-being. Having scored his first big hit with “Lucid Dreams” shortly before the release of this song, Juice is adjusting to a new way of life.  On April 19, 2019, he would further discuss his viewpoint on death in an interview with the New York Times:  It’s not as scary as I thought it was going to be, as far as graveyards…Damn near too much to take in, you almost gotta close your eyes, It’s so dead, it’s alive… It’s an interesting subject. It’s an enigma…I talk about stuff like that because those are subjects that people are a) too scared to touch on, or b) don’t do it the right way where people can learn from your mistakes. I cherish every mini-second of this life. What is this? The gates of Hell? If it’s meant for me to go out like this.  This song now sounds eerie as Juice WRLD himself passed away on December 8, 2019, six days after his 21st birthday. The song appeared to predict his own death as well, with lyrics claiming he won’t make it past this age:  What’s the 27 Clu-u-u-ub? We ain’t making it past 21",6.0,351.0,1329400.0

The song draws inspiration from ‘70s rock songs from artists like David Bowie and Queen.  The track is Harry Styles  debut solo single after releasing five studio albums and going on four world tours with the global sensation pop band One Direction. “Sign of the Times” is also the lead single from Harry’s debut self-titled album and was released on April 7, 2017, over a year after One Direction began their hiatus.  The track was teased through television ads, though the release date and title were later announced by Styles on Twitter along with the cover art on March 31, 2017, which aptly coincided the 30th anniversary of Prince’s ninth studio album, Sign O  the Times. Although Harry’s song shares a name with a song of Prince’s, the similarities do not continue beyond that. A collaborator of Prince’s, Sheena Easton, has even stated that the “Purple maestro” would have approved.  “Sign of the Times” debuted atop UK Official Singles chart with the #1 slot and landed #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 after only the first week of tracking. Harry taking the top position on the UK charts meant that he had dethroned his friend Ed Sheeran, who had spent the thirteen previous weeks in that #1 slot. To accompany the song’s debut, a two hour pre-recorded interview done with Harry’s close friend Nick Grimshaw was aired on BBC Radio 1.  “Sign of the Times” made its live TV debut on Saturday Night Live on April 15, 2017, the first episode of the show to be aired across the entirety of The United States of America simultaneously. Harry performed a second song, a new track released with his album on May 12, 2017, titled “Ever Since New York”.  The music video for this song was released on May 8, 2017 and depicted Styles flying through the air above mountains and walking on water. Upon release, the music video shot to the #8 slot on the YouTube trending list.",8.0,261.0,3697897.0

The song was released without warning to fans, less than an hour before he performed the track during his hosting debut for Saturday Night Live.  The song is Styles  second 2019 release, following October single “Lights Up,” with both tracks featuring on his sophomore album Fine Line. It was first teased by Styles in a tweet posted on October 22, 2019,  also referencing his 2017 track “Kiwi,” commenting:   Kiwi walked so Watermelon Sugar could run.  In March 2020 NPR Tiny Desk Concert Harry elaborated on what the track is about:  It’s kind of about that initial euphoria of when you start seeing someone, you start sleeping with someone or just being around someone and you have that excitement about them.  In March 2021, Harry received his first ever Grammy Award for “Best Pop Solo Performance” with this song.",1.0,150.0,1697581.0

The track features Harry speaking about his love and passion for a significant other, and the extent to which he would do things for his lover.  The release of the song was announced by Harry himself via social media alongside a cryptic image and a link to a music video trailer.  The track’s release was also assisted with by further cryptic, strategically planned marketing, advertising the fake location that the track’s video takes place in. On November 25, 2019, fans started noticing sponsored posts by a campaign on social media, specifically being targeted to them, of a fictitious island named “Eroda.” Posters, an advertising method not unfamiliar to Harry, for Eroda were also spotted in New York. Interestingly, the cryptic image posted by Harry also features fish that resemble the logo of Eroda. “Eroda” is “Adore” backwards, tying the mythical island in the video back in with the title of the track.

The song was first heard by the general public in Switzerland, during the first show of Harry’s second world tour. Later in that same show, the unreleased “Oh Anna” was also performed for the first time. “Medicine” was registered on ASCAP databases in April 2019.  The meaning of the song is subject to debate, which is only perpetuated by the song being unreleased. Some of the themes suggested, however, are drug use and oral sex. The second verse has lead to some fans and spectators to call the song a “new bi anthem”.",4.0,184.0,971458.0

Its music video — which was written and directed by Taylor and shot during the COVID-19 pandemic — finds Taylor shifting through different places by the magic of playing the piano. She revealed in a Tweet that everyone who was on-set took extra precautions to prevent the spread of the virus:  The entire shoot was overseen by a medical inspector, everyone wore masks, stayed away from each other, and I even did my own hair, makeup, and styling.  “cardigan” is believed to be the first part of folklore’s “Teenage Love Triangle,” told from the point of view of Betty. The storyline is followed by “august” and “betty.” Swift explained in a livechat the night of folklore’s release:  There’s a collection of three songs I refer to as The Teenage Love Triangle. These three songs explore a love triangle from all three people’s perspectives at different times in their lives.",22.0,212.0,2186369.0

Justin Vernon describes feelings of confusion about how quickly a lover moved on, while Swift offers a perspective about repeated warning signs that the relationship was no longer working. It’s also worth noting the contrast between Vernon’s rougher voice and Swift’s smoother one, which mirrors the contrast between their views of the relationship.  The song prompted many comparisons to Swift’s 2012 track “The Last Time,” another song that discusses the downfall of a relationship. Much like “exile,” Swift and featured artist Gary Lightbody’s voices contrast in tone, highlighting their differences.  “exile” is one of many folklore songs to contain a movie motif — other songs to do so include “the 1,” “this is me trying,” and “hoax.” It’s also her first collaboration with Bon Iver, who she called one of her “musical heroes” in an Instagram post announcing folklore.",6.0,204.0,2027487.0

Three days later, the song appeared on iTunes, revealing that it’s the third track on the album.  The song is a romantic track dedicated to Swift’s partner of three years, Joe Alwyn. It takes a wedding-like perspective on their relationship and shares information about their romance. A Twitter user who attended one of the secret sessions alleged that “‘Lover’ is Taylor’s favorite [original] song of all time,” having asked her directly during a Q&A.  On the day of its release, “Lover” reached number #1 on the US iTunes charts, making it her 35th song to do so. With this milestone, she extends her record as the female with the most #1 singles in iTunes  history.  The music video for the song was released on August 22, 2019, immediately following Swift’s Lover’s Lounge on YouTube. It features Swift and her love interest in a house inside a snow globe, illustrating the ups and downs of a relationship in progress. During Swift’s livestream, she further revealed that the concept for the music video originated from a lyric in her 1989 song, “You Are In Love”:  And so it goes You two are dancing in a snow globe, ‘round and  round",17.0,156.0,1891735.0

Taylor contemplates an alternate life in which her old wishes had “come true” and resulted in a relationship with an ex-lover.  Sharing a similar sentiment to Swift’s track “I Almost Do” from October 2012’s Red, “the 1” is a callback to the folk moments from the same record, folk music being a defining influence on folklore.",14.0,145.0,1796354.0

The song’s themes are of revenge and rebirth into a smarter, stronger person. It sees Swift move in a new sonic direction, incorporating electropop and an unexpected interpolation of the 90s hit “I’m Too Sexy” on the chorus.  In the week leading up to the track’s release, Swift cleared all previous social media presence and released three videos of a snake’s tail, body, and head; most considered this a reference to her widespread reputation as a “snake.” She then revealed the album title and cover, and announced the release dates for both the album and the single.  A short preview of the music video was aired on Good Morning America the morning of the song’s release; the clip was later posted to Swift’s social media accounts and official site. The full video premiered during the MTV Video Music Awards on August 27th, 2017 — check out the analysis here! The video made both VEVO and YouTube history, amassing the most views within 24 hours in history on both platforms.  On the reputation Album Release Party, Taylor revealed that “Look What You Made Me Do” started out as a poem:  It actually started with just a poem that I wrote about my feelings, and it’s basically about realizing that you couldn’t trust certain people, but realizing you appreciate the people you can trust. Realizing that you can’t just let everyone in, but the ones you can let in, you need to cherish. And it had all the verses in it, just basically as is.  Later on, after the music video of “Look What You Made Me Do” was released, Taylor herself came out to explain the true meaning behind the LWYMMD music video:",12.0,275.0,1652638.0

In an interview with PopBuzz, Eilish referred to the track, stating she knew from the beginning that “bad guy” would open the album.

Billie confirmed that the song would be receiving a music video with a comment on Instagram under a fan post.  On August 19th, the song reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 making her the first person born in the 21st century to have a #1 and dethroning Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road”, who held the #1 spot for 19 consecutive weeks.

Billie explained that the meaning of this song is directly opposite to the meaning of her other popular song, “COPYCAT.”  “COPYCAT” is basically about someone doing fucking everything you do. The idea of “idontwannabeyouanymore” was sort of like, exactly the opposite. You know, “COPYCAT” is like “you wanna be me so bad, I’m the shit” but really, no I’m not. And it’s like, you wanna be me.

When we all fall asleep, where do we go?","According to a January 2019 Alternate Press article, “bury a friend” is written from the perspective of a monster under Billie Eilish’s bed. The track details a confusing relationship with this ‘entity’ and ambiguously sets her up to be the monster itself.  A snippet of “bury a friend” was teased by Eilish on her Instagram page, as well as on Twitter and YouTube, on January 28, 2019. The visual depicts Billie’s face being grabbed by several gloved hands that reach in from off screen, until the closing lyrics and album title are displayed. She posted on Instagram the following day, announcing her debut album would be titled WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?  The song itself features a Prismizer effect, which manipulates pitch and frequency characteristics to achieve a choral phase, much like Eilish’s other January release, “WHEN I WAS OLDER.” Her friend Mehki Raine makes a few short appearances on the song and seems to be talking directly to Eilish.  Many fans believe an episode of sleep paralysis, which Billie shared on her Instagram story, was one of the inspirations for the song. In a reply to an Instagram comment, Eilish alluded to the validity of this theory.    On February 22, 2019, Billie posted a video in collaboration with YouTube Music, where she and her brother Finneas explain the meaning behind the song and the creation of it. When asked by Radio Energy for her favorites from the album, Eilish chose “bury a friend” as one of them.",6.0,273.0,2427215.0

On the song, Uzi references the luxury watch brand Patek Phillipe while bragging about his sexual encounters and accumulated wealth. He also references pop-culture icons like Naruto, Transformers, and Rey Mysterio.  The instrumental is built around a sample of the title track from the Death Parade anime series.  The song was first previewed on Instagram in June 2018, and quickly went viral. During his performance at Lollapalooza 2018, Uzi revealed the song’s title to be “5 Min,” a reference to the song’s run-time of 5:43. However, based on lyrics from the snippet, fans labeled the song as “(New) Patek,” which ultimately became the official song title.  The single artwork is a screenshot from the snippet video in which Uzi was dancing to the song. The glowing hand and the keyhole are a continuation of the Heaven’s Gate cult references present in the album artworks.",25.0,274.0,1202842.0

As with Justin’s recent singles  “What Do You Mean?” and “Sorry”, many listeners can’t help but think of Selena Gomez when they hear the track. On a recent interview on The Ellen Show though, Bieber named only three songs that are definitely inspired by his ex-girlfriend: “Mark My Words,” “What Do You Mean” and “Sorry.”. This doesn’t mean that the implied ex-lover is not Selena Gomez.  Given Ed Sheeran’s contribution, it’s likely an amalgam of Gomez and one of Ed Sheeran’s exes (Athina Andrelos? Nicole Scherzinger?), if the song is autobiographical at all.  The graffiti artwork for “Love Yourself” (Justin revealed the tracklist by posting pictures of the names of the tracks graffitied on walls all around the world) can be found in Oslo, Norway. This song premiered on Beats 1 Radio along with his Halsey collaboration “The Feeling.”  On November 14th, 2015 the official music video was released. Directed by Parris Goebel, it shows an arguing couple communicating by dancing around their house. The video stars renowned dancers, Keone and Mari Madrid.  On December 6th, 2016, it was announced that Justin Bieber’s single “Love Yourself” was nominated for two Grammy Awards: Song Of The Year and Best Pop Solo Performance  Fun Fact: On March 4th, 2016, Vanity Fair recruited renown African American actor, Morgan Freeman so he could recite the lyrics to this song in a witty and humorous way.  https://twitter.com/Beats1/status/663772277075410944",9.0,199.0,3973464.0

I m sorry, yeah Sorry, oh Sorry Yeah, I know that I let you down Is it too late to say I m sorry now?","Capping off a year filled with public apologies, “Sorry” is an upbeat anthem about asking for forgiveness.  On its surface, the second single from Purpose seems to be an apology to a woman for making mistakes in a relationship—Bieber said the song is “a little bit” about his ex Selena Gomez. However, Bieber has also suggested that the song is intended to be a more general apology to the world for his mistakes.  On “Sorry,” Bieber collaborated with songwriters Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter (both of whom annotated the song on Genius). Michaels and Tranter also wrote six songs from Selena Gomez’s Revival album, including several songs rumored to be about Bieber.  “Sorry” was produced by Skrillex and BLOOD, and it incorporates elements of tropical house, an EDM genre that’s characterized by a bright sound and Caribbean or Latin influences. BLOOD explained the music’s meaning:  The vocal manipulations make an ambiguous sound and a moment later Justin replies, ‘Sorry.’ Justin’s vocal delivery and the triumphant key of the song gave the narrative a warm color. The beat is saying moving forward, and apologizing, can be exciting and fun.  “Sorry” premiered on UK radio station CapitalFM. It was posted on YouTube together with a dance video featuring New Zealand’s ReQuest Crew. The video, directed and choreographed by Parris Goebel, features a unique new dance style that Goebel calls “Polyswagg,” a style she says combines “sassy woman fire with aggressive inner strength.”  The song debuted at #2 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart, blocked from the top spot by the debut of Adele’s “Hello.” However,  10 weeks after its debut, it finally reached #1, dethroning Adele’s smash hit.",10.0,172.0,2267217.0

Its release was accompanied by a lyric video, and an official music video that released at 12:00 PM EST on January 4th, 2020.  Yummy is a term used to describe something or someone that you find very attractive or appealing. Justin uses this term to describe his wife, Hailey Bieber, to which he is known for publicly gushing over. Whether it’s commenting on photos of her, or writing a poem for her, Justin always shows just how much he loves his wife.

He explains: “At times your memory of an old relationship will be clouded and you’ll only seem to remember the best parts of being with someone. Completely ignoring the reasons why things came to an end makes the idea of holding on to it or wanting to go back to it seem more enticing than it actually is.”",2.0,62.0,971721.0

It is the second single from the album, following “Someone You Loved.” As Lewis puts it in his well-renowned Instagram stories, this song is about him wanting a cuddle with his girlfriend of six months after she unexpectedly tells him that she hates him. Lewis says,  Nothing a couple of hugs can’t fix.  In another statement, Lewis said,  “Hold Me While You Wait” is a song I wrote about the uncertainty of being in a relationship when your partner isn’t sure what they want. There’s an impending hopelessness to the whole thing, on both sides, when they’re not sure whether they want to be in that relationship or not. For me it’s one of the most desperate places you can find yourself in.  “Hold Me While You Wait” debuted at #4 in the UK singles chart while “Someone You Loved” was still at #1. He became the second artist to have two singles in the Top 5, the first artist to accomplish this being Ed Sheeran.

Similar to how different flowers can mean different things, the smeraldo means “the truth I couldn’t tell,” according to the only flower shop that claims to sell it.    There are similarities between the lyrics of the song and “La Città di Smeraldo”, an Italian tale about a man who hides in his house because he’s afraid of showing himself. As he watches from the window, he falls in love with a woman stealing flowers from his garden to sell them.

The song gives a positive light over a friend’s absence, utilizing a seasonal metaphor to deliberate on how things will get better afterward.  Although essentially alternative hip-hop, BTS member J-Hope described the song as “a mix of Brit rock and electronic sounds”.  The official music video (MV) was released on YouTube at midnight, February 12, 2017. It was the most viewed video on YouTube that day, and broke the record for most-watched music video by any k-pop group on the day of release, surpassing 11.8 million views during 24 hours. In the following weeks, it also set records for being the fastest K-pop group MV to reach 10 million, 20 million, and 30 million views.  YNWA was released at midnight on February 13, 2017 (KST). For the first two hours after release, “Spring Day” scored a “roof hit” on Korea’s largest music streaming service, Melon. It was the first-ever roof hit for BTS. (A “roof hit” occurs when a song’s downloads and streams place it so far ahead in the first place that it pushes the charting graph Melon uses to track performance to a new high and maintains that pace for at least one hour.)    It remained at number one on Melon for 23 hours, at the time, the longest any BTS song had stayed at number one.  “Spring Day” went on to achieve an all-kill, meaning it ranked #1 on all eight real-time Korean music charts.  The song hit #1 on the major music charts of 14 countries and placed in Spotify’s Viral 50 in 12 countries, including the US. It debuted on Billboard’s Bubbling Under Hot 100 Chart at No. 15 and was the first song by a K-pop group to reach the top 10 on US iTunes. The MV was also the most popular music video in the US iTunes store.  “Spring Day” was nominated for 6 awards during the 2017 end of year awards season. It won Best Music Video (MAMA), Digital Bonsang (GDA), Weekly Popularity Award (MMA), and a daesang (“grand prize”) for Best Song of the Year (MMA).  One year after its initial release, Spring Day continued to chart in the top 50 songs on Melon.  Spring day was J-Hope’s 1st song singing without rapping.  A lot of fans from BTS’s Fanbase known as A.R.M.Y. had created a theory-based of a tragedy in South Korea not too long ago known as the Sinking of the MV Sewol where the Japanese-built South Korean ferry sank while carrying 476 people, mostly from Danwon High school. In total, 304 passengers and crew members died in the disaster.  https://youtu.be/dhME_nj5CWc  “Spring day” seems likely to be a tribute to the Sewol Ferry tragedy. Though not the complete song but one part is dedicated to that.  There are no official confirmations from BTS themselves on saying that “Spring Day” was actually about the Sewol ferry tragedy as BTS wished to leave the interpretation of the songs and MV to the viewers as they mentioned during their Wings Tour in Seoul Press conference.",10.0,90.0,925372.0

Megan first mentioned the song on July 18, 2019, via Twitter:  I feel like it’s only right I drop a hot girl summer song before the summer is over  Two days later, the rapper took to Instagram to tease a short snippet of one of her verses. Eight days after that, a longer snippet and official announcement followed, with Megan stating the track would be dropping on August 2, 2019.  On July 28, 2019, Megan had her first formal conversation with Nicki Minaj, via Instagram Live. Megan teased Nicki about her busy schedule stopping her from getting involved with the song, and hinted that if Nicki could free up her time, there would be a free space on the track.  Following this, on August 1, 2019, Megan took to Twitter to explain that the song’s release date would be delayed by seven days, but would also be “so worth the wait.” This lead to speculation that Nicki Minaj would appear on the track and needed extra time to add her verse.  On August 5, 2019, this theory was confirmed by Megan herself on Instagram:  THE HOT GIRLS TOOK OVER THE MF SUMMER SO IT WAS ONLY RIGHT TO GIVE THE HOTTIES THE OFFICIAL TRACK !!! HOT GIRL SUMMER FT. @nickiminaj and @tydollasign dropping 8/9 🔥🔥🔥🔥  Moments later, Nicki also promoted the song on Instagram. Both women shared the album artwork in their posts.

Say so","Despite not being released as an official single until the song was sent to radio months after release, “Say So” gained the most traction from Doja Cat’s sophomore album Hot Pink. This is mainly due to users on the popular video-sharing platform, TikTok, uploading videos of themselves dancing to it. Her August 2018 track “MOOO!” and March 2019’s “Juicy” had also achieved similar success on the platform.  On the upbeat R&B dance-inspired track, Doja sings about wanting her friend to stop “beating ‘round the bush” and confess their love to her. Because of a slight mix-up in the chorus of the song during its transcription on Genius, a small frenzy started on Twitter, with many fans thinking that Doja was singing “I get you hot and moaning.” This was later then cleared up by Doja after she tweeted the official lyrics on December 27, 2019, more than 7 weeks after its release.",1.0,142.0,1304111.0

After the song was introduced to the world with its music video release on YouTube, the song dominated social media with praise and became an instant meme.  At first glance, the video may have appeared bizarre to many, as Doja flaunted her cow costume with cheeseburgers and shakes. Once Doja started to rhyme, it became apparent she had created something unique. Lyrically, Doja’s verses are full of cow-related wordplay and she interpolates lines from some of hip-hop’s greatest joints. The beat is also undeniably catchy with its sultry guitars and melodies on the hook, which was produced by Doja Cat herself.  In an interview with Noisey, Doja explained how this song helped her career:  I feel really lucky that this song has created a platform for my debut because that wasn’t the intention behind the song. [My last] album actually got no support. There was nobody trying to push it. Now Katy Perry is tweeting me, which is cool. Chance is cool too. I know he’s a goofy guy and he appreciates DIY. It’s just cool to have these people supporting because it’s great exposure. I like them as well, which is a boner—I meant to say bonus.  After the success of the “Mooo!” video, Doja Cat decided to release an updated version of the song that could be streamed and purchased.",15.0,177.0,955017.0

The official remix was teased on Twitter by Doja Cat prior to its official release on May 1, 2020. This highly anticipated remix marks the first collaboration between the two artists.  On the remix, Nicki adds a new verse on a fresh new beat not present on the original. She shouts out her fellow peers, emphasizes her status as a legend within hip-hop, and even makes references to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent quarantine. Doja’s original second verse is kept intact, while Nicki provides singing vocals and a few bars for the outro.  Two versions of the remix exist, with the older version having an entirely different first verse by Nicki. Doja addressed this on Twitter, saying the proper current version would replace the older versions after its release.",19.0,126.0,919517.0

Travis and Kendrick detail the unique feelings they have for their love interests—especially when she’s not actually there.  Before performing this song live, Travis says he “wrote this song in my bedroom at one of the darkest times in my life.” This, combined with the lyrics in the chorus—specifically such terms as “goosebumps,” “numb,” and “Heimlich”—have led many fans to believe this song may have an underlying theme of prescription drug withdrawal.  The track’s music video was debuted exclusively on Apple Music before being released worldwide on April 3, 2017.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dst9gZkq1a8  In addition, Travis broke JAY-Z and Kanye West’s record of performing a song the most number of times in a live show (“Niggas in Paris” in France 2012) when he performed “goosebumps” 14 times in a row. Incredibly, he proceeded to break his own record the following week.",18.0,476.0,4825041.0

It serves as the lead single to his third studio album, ASTROWORLD, which was released more than a year after this song. It is produced by Murda Beatz, who has worked with Travis a few times before, most notably on the Texan artist’s September 2016 tracks, “sweet sweet” and “outside.”  The “butterfly effect” is a concept that explains and proves how small causes can have large effects. Travis is also using a double-entendre with “butterfly” wherein, as he refers to the doors on his Lamborghini car; he also describes moving to his new life, how great it is, and how he could never go back to the old one.  On May 15, 2017, Travis released the track on SoundCloud, along with two other songs: “A Man” and “Green & Purple.” However, “BUTTERFLY EFFECT” was the only one out of the three songs that was released as a proper single onto streaming services. The official music video was released almost two months after, on July 13, 2017.",17.0,240.0,2453351.0

This song was first teased by Kylie on April 22, 2019, when it played in an advertisement for her Kybrows cosmetic product. Following this, on May 3, 2019, Travis performed a portion of the song during his headlining set at JMBLYA 2019, and then again a week later, during his set at Rolling Loud Miami.  In late June 2019, Travis performed a large portion of the track, during his Morocco performance and on August 31, 2019, he previewed Lil Baby’s verse during a live show.  On September 30, 2019, Travis revealed the single’s final release date and cover art in an Instagram post. Coincidentally, two days before the scheduled release of “HIGHEST IN THE ROOM” Travis and Kylie reportedly called it quits on their relationship.  The song was officially released on October 4, 2019, along with accompanying visuals. However, the final version did not include the teased Lil Baby feature. It eventually was released on the song’s remix in December of 2019.  The track also became Scott’s second single to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and first to debut in the peak position.",12.0,237.0,2248083.0

The song is an ode to self-love, produced by Ricky Reed, who is behind a ton of 2016’s pop confections (Twenty One Pilots, Meghan Trainor, and more).  Lizzo described the process of making the song with Idolator:  It came from Ricky Reed and I. We have such a great chemistry in the studio and I think we had maybe made one or two songs prior. We were still doing chemistry tests with each other. We were in the studio and he was playing this piano riff and he was like, “How does this make you feel?”. I went through a lot of things in my head but it made me feel was like the hair toss emoji. You know, the pink sweater emoji girl with the hair. So I went from that hair toss, to checking my nails. It was a natural statement that came out my mouth. Ricky was like “feeling good as hell”. We just rolled with that. After that everything just kind of came out so easily. That’s when I think our chemistry was really sealed. I just felt like everything’s going to be okay.",0.0,51.0,522623.0

To promote the single, four remixes were also commissioned.  Throughout the song, Lizzo states that she ‘doesn’t discriminate’ when it comes to men in her dating pool. When asked about the meaning of the song, Lizzo commented:  From this black girl to the world, I want you to identify with my story no matter what you like in yo’ holes. I want people to feel free, I want people to have fun, I want these boys to know that you could be my next victim… if you play your cards right.”  The song was accompanied with a music video the same day of its release. In the music video, Lizzo dances in front of the iconic music note wall where Prince commemorated in 1977.",2.0,37.0,272486.0

Featuring the iconic rapper Missy Elliott, the song is about body acceptance and how Lizzo needs a heavy beat to dance since slow songs are not enough for all she has to offer.  In an interview with Exclaim!, Lizzo spoke about her collaboration with Missy Elliott on “Tempo”:  I’m very fortunate to be in a position where I have access to send Missy [Elliott] beats, and I have the privilege of being like, ‘Yo, let’s get Missy on this track.’ I was really hopeful that she would hop and she did, and now it’s become this moment for me. You know, when the song was first going down, it was more like ‘Finally I can talk my shit about being a big girl,’ but when Missy jumped on it, it really did make it a full-circle moment of being seen by her existing when I was younger. Hopefully I can really do the same for young girls today. But really, I was just making bops.",6.0,52.0,191079.0

The song went on to become one of Future’s highest-charting singles ever, peaking at #5 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song is also certified 6X platinum by the RIAA.  https://twitter.com/1future/status/854531549798080512  The song also spawned the #MaskOffChallenge, which participants dance and play instruments to the song.

In addition to referencing the term lowlife, this song can be interpreted as a play on the term “high life,” generally understood as a luxurious lifestyle afforded to the rich and famous. As supporters of the “low life,” The Weeknd and Future turn “high life” accommodations into austere ones.  The Weeknd released “Low Life” as a Christmas gift for their fans after some teasing. His “Pass Dat (Remix)” was also included in the mini-release. “Low Life” was later revealed to be included on Future’s album EVOL.  https://twitter.com/theweeknd/status/680256090219646976",29.0,243.0,2337528.0

The song is an ode to Drake’s old motto no new friends.  The song serves as a defiant ode to people who try to come back and profit off of Drake and Future’s success after abandoning them during their struggles.  The music video features iconic rooftop dancing from Future and his close collaborators Metro Boomin and DJ Esco, the coolest DJ in the world.  https://twitter.com/Drake/status/619529041993965568?lang=en",23.0,154.0,1282684.0

She also references her most public romantic relationships over the years and does not shy away from name-dropping in the process.  The song was released on November 3, 2018, minutes before an episode of Saturday Night Live aired. In a promotional clip, cast member and Ariana’s ex-fiancé, Pete Davidson, made a joke about the two’s failed engagement. Once she was made aware of the clip, she expressed her disgust in a since deleted tweet, writing:  for somebody who claims to hate relevancy u sure love clinging to it huh  She then followed her post with another, tweeting the phrase that would become her new mantra in 2018:  thank u, next  “thank u, next” debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Ariana’s eleventh top-ten entry and her highest charting single to date, surpassing her Iggy Azalea assisted single “Problem,” which peaked at #2 in 2014. Additionally, it was the first song by a lead female artist to debut atop the US charts since Adele’s “Hello” in 2015.  The music video for “thank u, next” was released on November 30, 2018, and is directed by frequent collaborator Hannah Lux Davis, who has previously worked with Ariana on videos for “breathin,” “Side to Side,” and more. The video interpolates iconic early-2000s movies Mean Girls, Bring It On, Legally Blonde, and 13 Going on 30, and features cameo appearances from celebrities including Kris Jenner, Troye Sivan, as well as Ariana’s former Victorious co-stars Daniella Monet, Elizabeth Gillies and Matt Bennett, among others. The music video became a huge success, accumulating more than 55.4 million views in its first 24 hours, becoming the biggest-ever global debut for a music video on YouTube.

This is the lead single to her fourth studio album, Sweetener. It also marks Ariana’s return to music after a hiatus from performing in the wake of the 2017 Manchester bombing attack that occurred during her Dangerous Woman Tour.  After teasing the single through a series of photos taken of her wearing a sweatshirt with the lead single’s title and through her Instagram story, Ariana broke her social media silence to confirm the single via her twitter alongside with teardrop emoji, and stating: “missed you”.  For the single cover, Ariana looks on as a rainbow rests across her eyes. Rainbows are a natural phenomenon that appear after rain, as the sun refracts through the water droplets. Symbolically, a rainbow tends to represent the idea of hope and optimism. The image illustrates the idea that Ariana’s teardrops have faded, resulting in the rainbow, and she is ready to move on.  Her accompanying music video was teased on Instagram on April 19, 2018, and was officially published on Youtube the next day.",7.0,194.0,2750926.0

Lyrics comin  at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad) Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin  I m a human What I gotta do to get it through to you I m superhuman? Innovative and I m made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin  off of me and it ll glue to you and I m devastating, more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin  audience a feeling like it s levitating Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off, they ll be celebrating  Cause I know the way to get  em motivated I make elevating music, you make elevator music ""Oh, he s too mainstream."" Well, that s what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it ""It s not hip-hop, it s pop,""— cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock, shock rap with Doc Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make  em lose it ""I don t know how to make songs like that I don t know what words to use."" Let me know when it occurs to you While I m rippin  any one of these verses that versus you It s curtains, I m inadvertently hurtin  you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?! Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie But look at the accolades these skills brung me Full of myself, but still hungry I bully myself  cause I make me do what I put my mind to And I m a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues, but it s still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you I m drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel I ma sleep in the front seat Bumpin  Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky"" But in my head there s something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and here s what they want from me They re askin  me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have, then you may be a little patient And more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it, life s handin  you lemons? Make lemonade then! But if I can t batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?! Don t mistake him for Satan; it s a fatal mistake If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and Don t be a retard—be a king? Think not Why be a king when you can be a god?","“Rap God” is Eminem’s braggadocious ode to himself and his career. Over its six-minute run-time, he references comic books, throws back to his old songs, and raps crazily fast.  In a Q&A with MSN Music Em was asked whether he felt like a Rap God or an underdog, to which he responded with:  I think everything switches back and forth from hour to hour, day by day with me. That whole ‘Rap God’ record pretty much from top to bottom is tongue in cheek. So I mean, do I want to feel like that? Maybe sometimes. Again, it goes back to everybody who competitive raps and does this for just purely the sport of it wants to be the best. Again, that’s why Kendrick’s verse worked so well because he only said what every rapper’s already thinking, If you don’t want to be the best, then why are you rapping?  This song landed Eminem a spot in The Guinness Book of World Records: Most words in a hit single:  The single ‘Rap God’ from Eminem packed a mouth-filling 1,560 words into its 6 min 4 sec runtime.  However, in 2015 Harry Shotta broke Eminem’s world record of most words in a track. Eminem’s “Rap God” has 1560 words, while Harry Shotta’s “Animal” has 1771.",106.0,1769.0,16954391.0

The diss track dropped eleven days after “RAP DEVIL” and was discussed during Eminem’s four-part interview with Sway.  Em began targeting MGK following inappropriate Twitter comments about his daughter Hailie Jade in 2012. According to the second part of the Sway interview, it was MGK’s subliminal disses during Power 106’s May 2017 “L.A. Leakers (Freestyle)” and Tech N9ne’s March 2018 track, “No Reason,” that inspired Eminem to fire back.  Coincidentally, Killshot is the name of a 2008 movie directed by John Madden, and filmed in Eminem’s hometown of Detroit, Michigan. For that reason, fan theories have suggested Eminem must have known about the film. The plot features main character Carmen Colson, who is targeted by an experienced, psychopathic hitman. Colson Baker is Machine Gun Kelly’s government name.",57.0,1181.0,6617290.0

In particular, they become Godzilla, a fictional sea monster that is known for its mass destruction and endless killing.  While this track marks the first collaboration between Juice WRLD and Eminem, Juice had previously listed Em as one of his biggest influences and has frequently referenced his music, perhaps most notably on his May 2018 track, “Lean Wit Me.” On October 25, 2018, Juice joined Tim Westwood TV, where he almost freestyled an hour over different Eminem beats.  This track also serves as Juice WRLD’s first posthumous release since his passing on December 8, 2019—six days after his 21st birthday. Juice reportedly recorded the chorus for the track before his untimely death, although he was unable to complete his actual verse for the song in time. Later, on January 17, 2020, a picture surfaced on XXL that depicted Juice WRLD and his friends after he recorded his feature.  On January 17, 2020, Genius broke down the song in an edition of their Song Stories series. In March 2020 interview with Genius, producer d.a. got that dope broke down how the song came together.  On February 5, 2020, the song received a Gold certification by Music Canada making it the first official certification for the single.  The official music video dropped March 9, 2020. Directed by Cole Bennett, one of the biggest names in music video production, and starring Dr. Dre, retired boxer Mike Tyson, Eminem, actress Anna Dahl, and actor George Todd McLachlan, portraying a young Eminem. Juice WRLD appears in the video as well using older stock footage.  On February 25th Em launched the #GodzillaChallenge which encouraged fans to spit the fast third in creative ways, lip syncing or rapping, on the Triller app in order to win a shout out and signed lithograph. https://twitter.com/Eminem/status/1232374897525108736  Then, on March 18th, Eminem chose his winner, Jack Sherlock.

It’s considered one of Eminem’s best songs—if not his best song—and is also his biggest hit to date.  Written between breaks on the set of 8 Mile, engineer Steven King claimed all three verses were rapped “in one take""—but Eminem has since shed doubt on that claim. The beat was older than the song though—Em actually recorded a completely different version of the song over the beat. The demo was eventually released in 2014, dubbed “Original Demo Version,” as part of the SHADY XV compilation album—but that version was more like a dance song.  “Lose Yourself” reached #1 in 20 countries – Eminem’s first in the US, holding the top position for 12 weeks, making it become the third-longest chart topper from a movie soundtrack (behind “I Will Always Love You” and “End Of The Road”). It became the first rap song to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song, won two Grammys (Best Male Rap Solo Performance & Best Rap Song), and has since been certified Diamond (10x Multi-Platinum) in the United States.  The song was used in an iconic Apple iPod commercial and an instrumental version was used in a Chrysler Super Bowl ad that featured Em. It was also performed at the 2020 Academy Awards.

Incidentally, it also marks the fourth time Eminem and Rihanna have collaborated.  This dark and emotional track has Eminem considering his Shady alter-ego a monster. The monster could also be the fame which has taken so much from him, or perhaps the true monster is his mind and the demons that plague it.  This hook was co-written by Bebe Rexha and Jon Bellion, and went on to win the award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 2015 Grammys.",39.0,539.0,4600966.0

In September 2018, the song topped the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Cardi’s third #1 single, and Maroon5’s fourth. The song dethroned the uber-popular “In My Feelings”, by Drake, which led the pack for ten weeks.

The song is an evolution of the more acoustic sound put forth in Maroon 5’s sixth studio album, Red Pill Blues, and specifically their #1 hit, “Girls Like You.”. Lyrically, the song is a reflective look back at the past, while also paying homage to those in our lives who may no longer be with us.  Structurally, the song is a reimagining of “Pachelbel’s Canon”, a famous late 17th/early 18th-century canon created by German Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel. The progression of “Memories” borrows from the harmonic sequence of “Pachabel’s Canon”, with additional changes made by the song’s diverse team of songwriters who include Billboard-charting hip-hop recording artist Jon Bellion and members of the production and songwriting team The Monsters & Strangerz.",2.0,104.0,1558470.0

Produced by Young Shad and Ricky Racks, Thug comes hard with his crooning and braggadocios style to brag about his bestie.  This song was met with controversy upon release when Louisiana rapper Tokyo Vanity threatened to sue Thugger. According to Complex Magazine, Vanity is threatening to sue Thugger for copyright infringement, claiming he stole her song “That’s My Best Friend.”  The Fader interviewed the director of the music video, Be El Be, who shared his opinion on who Thuggers “best friend” really is:  If [Young Thug is] his own butler, if he’s catching himself with himself, making love to himself, if he’s in the bathroom getting changed and it’s just him and him—it’s showing his best friend is himself. That self-esteem! He’s a very stylish young man, so I would say that the inside meaning of that is that he is his own best friend.  On September 14th, 2015 the official music video was released by Young Thug. It is co-directed by Be El Be and the visuals show Thugger running into himself in everything he does. Pitchfork said it best (in regards to describing the video):  Young Thug’s video for “Best Friend” begins with Young Thug walking in on Young Thug, who’s in the process of hooking up with Young Thug. Then, Thug jumps in a car driven by Thug. Eventually, Thug’s head is served at a dinner attended by Thug.   Fun Fact: 5 months later from the release of the music video, Young Thug read out the lyrics on GQ  so people can understand him better and simply for laughs and giggles!  https://youtu.be/IVRXJ1Gd33g",20.0,164.0,1784840.0

The single was first teased on May 11, 2019, when flyers were thrown out to attendees of Thug’s set at Miami’s Rolling Loud Festival. They featured the first line of Thug’s verse on the track and teased the song’s artwork and color scheme. https://twitter.com/1sabsad/status/1127412788354330624  The song was teased again on May 21, 2019, during a since-deleted live stream on Thug’s YouTube channel titled “Meet Me At The London,” which spanned over the course of more than twelve hours.

The track is directed at her ex G-Eazy after she was “cheated on in front of the entire world, like, a billion times.”  This song dives into the personal feelings of Halsey after being a very public relationship. The track is different to her earlier conceptual records Badlands and hopeless fountain kingdom, due to the fact there was no role to play:  It’s the most raw thing I’ve ever made… Here, I have this record where it’s just me, no character. It’s about my life and my relationship that the world has watched so closely… It’s just me.  The song premiered on Zane Lowe’s “World Record” on Beats 1 Radio, and was followed by an interview with the artist about “Without Me”.  In that interview, Halsey stated that the song was not going to be part of a future album, and described it as a “stand-alone record;” however, on 13 September 2019, “Without Me” was revealed to be track 9 on her third studio album Manic.  In honor of the song hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Halsey released a remix of the track featuring Juice WRLD.",8.0,197.0,2111713.0

The context behind family and addictions provides evidence that “Colors” is about The 1975’s frontman Matty Healy.  In October of 2015, Halsey mentioned during one of her shows that her and Matty met at that particular venue. She has also mentioned him as an inspiring influence. Billboard brought him up in an interview, questioning the nature of their relationship, to which she responded:  We’re both attracted to characters, and we saw that in each other. I spent a lot of time watching him and he spent a lot of time loving being watched. But if you think he’s the first red-wine-drinking, pretty-boy rocker in skinny jeans I’ve … been associated with, you’re out of your fucking mind.  Halsey posted images of Healy on her Instagram, as well as a personal post on her (now deleted) personal Tumblr in July of 2014 about her sentiments towards their relationship.  Despite the depth of information provided, the two are not explicitly confirmed to have been a legitimate couple. At the time, Halsey was in a relationship with Norwegian hip-hop artist and producer Lido, who worked extensively on many tracks from Badlands and went on to produce many songs in her discography.  “Colors” was the second single from Halsey’s debut Badlands, announced through a mural in Brooklyn, NY in January of 2016. The official music video features MTV’s Teen Wolf star Tyler Posey and tells a tale of unrequited love.",14.0,126.0,1256198.0

In the track, Tones sings about the struggles of being a musical performer, inspired by her experiences as a busker. She explained to Billboard:  It’s a song about a moment where I felt frustrated about how people had no patience anymore. […] If you replace the word ‘dance’ with ‘sing,’ it’s pretty self-explanatory. I’ve literally turned quotes that people say to me into lyrics – they’re all very real. […] It was one night where people just wouldn’t let me be. I’d been busking for seven or eight hours, and I had done six encores. So many people get inspired in the moment and just make up bullshit to try to give you hope. Every person swears black and blue on their kids’ lives that they’re someone and they can help me and they never do.  “Dance Monkey” was written in October 2018, at her manager’s house. Tones posted a video of herself performing the track the day she wrote it.",1.0,148.0,2168788.0

A rhythm is given by xylophones, guitars, and percussions. The style and rhythm have been noted as close to the  Sia successes, “Cheap Thrills”, which has caused some controversy. Ed has denied receiving inspiration from the track. Just like “Cheap Thrills”, however, “Shape of You” was written with the intention of it being recorded by Rihanna, but Sheeran later decided to keep it for himself.  In the song, Sheeran sings about meeting someone at a bar and falling in love with her; a love distinct from those in much of his previous work as it’s more focused on the physical than the emotional.  Sheeran had teased the song through a tweet that he had posted on January 5, 2017. The video had a colon that would then merge into a human body, referencing the “body”-inspiration of the song.  As of August 29, 2017, “Shape Of You” set a Billboard record, spending 33 straight weeks in the Top 10 of the Hot 100 chart.  On September 22, 2017, the track became the most streamed song of all time on the Spotify plaform at 1.318 billion plays. Sheeran passed Drake who previously held the record with “One Dance.”  The song won a Grammy Best Pop Solo Performance at the 2018 Grammys held on January 28, 2018.  On January 24th, 2019, “Shape Of You” was certified Diamond by the RIAA, selling over ten million units.",9.0,309.0,14363991.0

It is the fourth single from Sheeran’s 2017 album ÷.  He explained his motivation for writing “Perfect” in an interview with Music Choice:  I think the song “Perfect” is actually better than “Thinking Out Loud.” I think there was always a scare that “Thinking Out Loud” would define me and define my career. So I, I wrote a lot of songs trying to beat it and now I think, I think I have beaten it.  Thematically, the song is reminiscent of “18,” a song he wrote for his friends in One Direction.  The “Perfect Duet” featuring Beyoncé was released on Dec. 1, 2017 and the “Perfect Symphony” with Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli came out two weeks later on Dec. 15.  The song reached number one on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart.",8.0,340.0,5963546.0

My grandmother was very ill during the time I was making the record and passed away at the end of me making the record so we wrote this song as a tribute and just left it on.  Ed admitted he initially didn’t want to put it on the record at all, and it was his grandfather who convinced him to do it:  My grandfather just turned to me [at the funeral], he was like you have to put that out, that has to go on the record. It’s such a good memory, that’s why it’s ended up on there.  The deluxe edition of the album also features another, more upbeat ode to Ed’s grandparents.",3.0,95.0,1826802.0

She first teased the single at the end of the music video for her previous single “Bad Liar,” with about 17 seconds of the “Fetish” video.  Although she was in a relationship with The Weeknd during recording of this track, it is not built around their relationship. Selena commented on this topic during a June 9, 2017 interview on The Zach Sang Show:  I think for me, I like to keep that really separate. … So as much as that has been inspiring … the moment I start doing something because I’m influenced by someone else, it just doesn’t work out.

It is a track from Selena’s upcoming album, preceded by its vulnerable and emotional lead single, “Lose You To Love Me,” which was released only a day before. It is also worth noting that the music videos for both songs were collaborations with Apple, and both videos were “Shot on iPhone” for the campaign of the same name.  Rumors about the song started swirling on October 16th, 2019, when a credible ‘insider’ from the music forum ATRL commented “2.2.22.23” on a thread discussing Selena’s music. Fans then pieced together the information and theorized that Selena would release new music on the 22nd and 23rd of October, alongside a music video for each song. Later, he then proceeded to reveal the title of the 2 songs: “Lose You to Love Me” and “Look At Her Now.”  Fans also speculated that the childhood photos Selena had posted were an easter egg for “Look At Her Now”.",2.0,61.0,855418.0

Camila was born in Cojímar, award – or consejo popular – that belongs to the municipality of La Habana Del Este, which is a district of Havana.  Camila immigrated to the US when she was still a kid:   I was almost 7 at the time, born in Havana, Cuba. My papá is puro Mexicano and we lived back and forth between the heat of Havana and the concrete jungle of Mexico City. I didn’t realize it then, but, boy, does it hit me now. I realize how scary it must have been for them.  The song was released as a “Summer Double Feature” along with “OMG” from Camila Cabello’s debut album. The song’s music video was released on October 24. On November 9, a “vertical video” was released for the track.  Camila confirmed it to be a single on August 30. As “Crying in the Club” won’t be included on the album, “Havana” is the lead single of the record. Camila has publicly stated that some people doubted that “Havana” had the potential of being a single, including herself. As of now, it is her favorite song to perform.  There are at least nine versions of the song, including a solo version, a Spanglish version, and a Spanglish remix featuring Daddy Yankee. In an interview with 98.7 AMP, Camila stated that Havana was the hardest song to write of the whole album:  I have performed a version of it in Chicago for a radio show that I had. And, before the song came out, I re-wrote the pre-chorus. That’s how many different times the song had to be worked on.  According to producer Louis Bell, “Havana” is definitely a “Camila song” and it changed the tone of her debut album:  The album started off more serious — dealing with relationship stuff, dealing with a lot of heartbreak, dealing with a lot of life things, with the Fifth Harmony thing. It started off darker, but then towards the end, it lightened up because of where she was in her life. She felt more liberated.  The track eventually reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Thug’s first #1 hit and Cabello’s first solo #1 hit as a lead artist. On April 12, 2018, the song was certified 5x multi-platinum.  On July 3rd, 2018, “Havana” ended it’s 46 week run on the Billboard Hot 100, making it her first solo single to spend the most weeks on the Hot 100.",12.0,224.0,3779556.0

The single was released alongside “Real Friends.”  Camila Cabello teased an unofficial music video via Twitter on December 29, 2017, calling it a “New Year’s Eve gift” for her fans. On February 14, 2018, she announced her first tour as a solo artist, which was named after the song. According to a 2017 Rolling Stone article, it was “inspired by a relationship she had a couple of years back.”  Camila also considers it to be the best track she’s written so far, explaining in a September 2017 Official Charts article that it only took an hour to write. “Never Be The Same” can be seen as the prequel of the relationship that broke Camila in her subsequent January 2018 track, “Consequences”:  …It’s kind of like the aftermath of ‘Never Be the Same.’ I feel like a lot of the songs could be in this one story, and all the different phases, and I feel like ‘Consequences’ is the aftermath of a love that was intoxicating like that, and hard to get out of your mind; or the kind of love that you compare to everybody else and it’s not the same.  –from Coup de Main magazine (February 2018)",4.0,154.0,1919164.0

The track was initially supposed to be on her debut album, Camila, (previously The Hurting, The Healing, The Loving) but she later revealed that it had been dropped from the final tracklist.  To promote the song, Camila sent fans part of the cover art in order to complete and reveal the artwork. She gave her first live performance of the track at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards, where she also sang “I Have Questions” as a part of Xfinity Encore at the show.  Camila broke down the song ON AIR with Ryan Seacrest, saying:  For me, the club is kind of like a euphemism. The lyrics say stuff like “Let the music lift you up like you’ve never been this free, let the music lift you up like you’ve never been so high.” I feel like for me, that was more of what the writing process and what the album making process was saying to me.  In a 2019 interview to The Telegraph, Camila confessed that she regrets releasing “Crying in the Club”:  I didn’t write and it didn’t feel like me. I had the chorus to “Havana”, but I went with what was safe, what industry people said had worked before. Turns out, no one has a clue.",4.0,95.0,788094.0

Three days later, she revealed that “Real Friends” almost didn’t make it to the album because the song had been finished too close to the deadline.

It’s also one of the two tracks which Camila feels that best represent her in the album.

The track won Gaga her first Grammy for Best Dance Recording at the 52nd Grammy Awards, while it was also nominated for Song of the Year and Record of the Year.

R. Kelly joins in to be the actual lover who she goes to.  Considering the song’s subject matter, the cover art fits, as opposed to being sexual for the sake of marketing.  Due to hitting #1 on iTunes charts all over the world, it was promoted from ARTPOP’s 1st promotional single to the 2nd official single.  Since the song’s release in 2013, R. Kelly’s allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct grew to monumental levels. As a proponent of Gaga proceeded to face criticism as she continued to keep silent on the matter. However, she finally took to Twitter on January 9, 2019, to share a note regarding the situation. She stated her belief in the accusers and support of all victims of sexual assault, denounced R. Kelly and his allegations, and explained how her past experiences and mental capacity at the time led to the song being pushed forward:  The song is called ‘Do What U Want (With My Body)’, I think it’s clear how explicitly twisted my thinking was at the time. If I could go back and have a talk with my younger self I’d tell her to go through the therapy I have since then, so that I could understand the confused post-traumatic state I was in. […] I’m sorry, both for my poor judgment when I was young, and not for speaking out sooner.  She also announced the removal of the song from digital marketplaces and streaming platforms. Two days later on January 11th, the song and remix EP were removed, though the re-release with fellow pop artist Christina Aguilera remains available.  The same day, Christina expressed her support on Twitter:  Being a survivor of past predators myself, these lines spoke to me, which is why I did the song. I embrace all survivors of sexual and domestic violence and abuse holding a special place in my heart, and you @ladygaga, for doing the right thing!",2.0,118.0,895032.0

But at the same time, we always let each other know, “I’ll keep your number saved in case you need me. In case you need someone to talk to. If you want a conversation. If you fall for me again.” It was a sense of comfort, just by having her number. I still have her number to this day.",5.0,73.0,907007.0

Noteworthy is this also only the second song ever from Lenny, with a feature on it, with the first one being “Lust” featuring Janelle Kroll.  “Trap” is Lenny and Lil Baby showing how they’re both dealing with their newfound fame and wealth after being raised in a tough environment. The pair share a lot of similarities, with them both being raised by a single mother in poverty, then turning to drug dealing at a young age to earn money. Lenny has been verbal on many occasions, that if it wouldn’t have been for rap, he would most likely still be selling drugs, which he even has a song about, titled “Dope Dealer” released through his rap-collective GØDD COMPLEXx. Same goes for Baby, who never thought that rap was going to be his career. But after being pursued by Quality Control Music’s Pee and Coach K to keep on rapping, kept him out of the drug selling business",3.0,46.0,185248.0

Even though it’s obvious that his perception of love is conditional and flawed, remnants of his presence still linger and she continues to think about him. He isn’t willing to go the extra mile to maintain the relationship and in that way, he doesn’t understand that being in love isn’t just all the positive things, but it also includes addressing the challenges and problems that arise.",0.0,62.0,422228.0

It received an early digital release on November 1, 2017, two days before the album came out.  In an interview with Froggy 99.9, Shelton explained the songwriting process for the song and confirmed it is about his girlfriend, singer Gwen Stefani:  We were playing in Louisiana. I got to the gig, and I was sitting on the bus, and all of a sudden, I started playing this little lick on the guitar, and I came up with this chorus, “Turnin  Me On.” And I thought it was good enough, that it scared me. So I stopped working on the song, and I texted Jessi Alexander, and I said hey, I need your help, I think I got something here that’s pretty cool and I’m gonna screw it up. And she and Josh Osborne helped … basically, they wrote the song. I just had the chorus, but they wrote the song, and they even ended up making the chorus a little bit better. But, I just thought it was a cool song. I was literally thinking of my girlfriend when I wrote this thing. I don’t write that many very personal songs, but this one, I think, hits the mark.",1.0,8.0,54440.0

Shelton didn’t write the tune; it was penned by Andy Albert, Marc Beeson and Wyatt Earp, but its lyrics about breaking up with a woman who’d wronged him got people talking in the wake of the singer’s divorce from Miranda Lambert. Many wondered if this was a grenade aimed at his ex.  Jake Owen was also offered the song, as he was going through a marital breakdown around the same time as Blake Shelton. “You’d be so surprised,” Owen told Taste of Country.  When I was going through my divorce everybody – every songwriter, everyone – was sending me songs that were like that. That new song Blake Shelton has out, ‘She’s Got a Way With Words’? That was pitched to me and I remember vividly the first time I heard that, I was like, ‘That’s a really good, cool song, very well written. But if I record this song and I’m taken literally – I don’t want my ex to perceive I did that to her.’  Andy Albert, Marc Beeson and Wyatt Earp put together most of the lyrics by just throwing jokes and phrases at each other, many of which ultimately ended up going into the song. “We’re just laughing over them for two or three hours, and then we started to arrange the different lines and put them together in a way that we thought made some sense,” Albert told Taste of Country.  Shortly after hearing the song, Shelton indicated that he wanted to cut it. He put the tune on hold in the early part of 2015, months before he and Lambert announced their divorce. “Then, unfortunately, he went through all of his personal stuff, the divorce and all of that, and I think the song sort of rang true to him in all that was going on in his life,” Albert said. “I feel like that’s one of the reasons why it made it all the way to the end [of the recording process].”",3.0,19.0,49844.0

It became an international success, reaching #1 in five countries and peaking at #9 in the United States. Seventeen years after its initial release, “Bohemian Rhapsody” re-entered the pop charts in the US, peaking at #2 after being featured in the 1992 hit movie Wayne’s World. In 2002, the song was listed at #1 in a Guinness World Records poll as Britain’s favourite single of all time—ranking higher than four Beatles tracks and “Imagine” by John Lennon.  Complex and operatic both musically and lyrically, “Bohemian Rhapsody” (like Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven” and The Eagles‘ “Hotel California”) has attracted endless fan theories and commentary. The surviving band members have claimed that the narrative is based on the Faust legend; critics have found possible sources in opera and Freddie Mercury’s personal biography; but like any good piece of art, it’s open to interpretation.  The word “Bohemian” seems to refer to a group of artists and musicians from the 19th century, known for defying convention and living with disregard for standards; as opposed to the region of Bohemia in the Czech Republic. Meanwhile the term “rhapsody” (derived from the Greek: ῥαψῳδός or rhapsōidos for a reciter of epic poetry, or a rhapsodist) is a piece of classical music with distinct sections that are played as one movement. Rhapsodies often feature dense themes or narratives.  As of December 2018, “Bohemian Rhapsody” is the most streamed song of the 20th century.  “Bohemian Rhapsody” has got a very diverse song structure. It includes: • Intro (0:00-0:49) • Ballad section (0:49-2:37) • Brian May‘s’ guitar solo (2:37-3:05) • Operatic verse (3:05-4:07) • Hard-rock verse (4:07-4:54) • Coda (4:54-5:55)",21.0,408.0,8827509.0

It’s a simple song, an energetic song that sees lead singer Freddie Mercury on a high that he wants to stay in, letting nobody pull him down.  Critically, the song performed well, releasing as a single after the release of album Jazz. Despite reaching number 9 on the UK charts and later going Platinum, it only hit 86 on the US charts. Time has only increased its popularity, as it is often included in “Greatest Hit” compilations and stands as their second most played song on Spotify with over 750 million plays as of January 2020.",8.0,117.0,1056000.0

You wanna try . . ","“Killer Queen” was the breakthrough song that turned Queen into worldwide rock stars. Peaking at #2 in the UK, the song became a hit in seven other European countries as well. “Killer Queen” was the first Queen single to successfully ‘cross the pond’, becoming a top 20 hit in the U.S. and Canada, as well as a top 30 hit in Australia.  In the New Musical Express of November 2, 1974, the song’s writer and Queen’s frontman Freddie Mercury elucidates on this song: “It’s about a high class call girl. I’m trying to say that classy people can be whores as well. That’s what the song is about, though I’d prefer people to put their interpretation upon it – to read into it what they like.”  While it may seem like a typical popular song, the structure utilised in the song is quite unusual. There are 4 bar phrases immediately followed by 5 bar phrases and then 2 bar phrases, with tempo changing from 12/8 to 6/8 and vice versa.  The main key being Eb major is very unorthodox for Rock music, as guitars don’t usually play flats. Brian May, who pioneered a heavier hard rock sound, had been struck with hepatitis during the majority of the recording. Upon initially hearing the song, Brian was shocked over the more progressive, lighter sound. Nevertheless, the rest of the band left space for Brian to record his own iconic guitar melodies.  The song includes prominent uses of multi-tracking, not just on the vocals, but also in the guitar solo. Other effects used include the flanger (pitch bends), panning (sound moving from the left ear to the right), portamento/glissando (sliding from one note to another), distortion (giving a creamy feel), wah-wah on the guitar, string bending and sliding.  The band had decided not to use the ubiquitous synthesiser, as they thought it was superfluous. Instead, instrumentation utilised includes a jangle piano (detuned), drum kit, bass guitar, electric guitar and vocals.",15.0,121.0,766961.0

The song became a hit in 17 countries, but nowhere larger than in the United States, where it became the biggest-selling Queen record ever, topping both the Pop and Disco charts, as well as reaching #2 on the Soul chart.  Composed by bassist John Deacon, the song features an instantly recognizable funk bass riff, and high energy, bordering on manic, vocals by Freddie Mercury.  According to Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic, this surprise crossover hit was responsible for a change in the band’s musical style.  [The success] pushed the members of Queen into some questionable musical decisions in the near future. The most blatant and negative of these was their decision to commit the bulk of their next effort, 1982’s Hot Space, to experimental, dancey funk and electrified soul – a catastrophic move which alienated many longtime fans and effectively killed the band’s career in America. Lucky for them, the rest of the world wasn’t as unforgiving and quickly embraced Queen once again when they retreated to somewhat more familiar (though no less eclectic) hard rock territory with 1984’s The Works.",14.0,98.0,723363.0

The track is built around a bass-heavy trap beat and a looping sample of DJ Frank Ski’s “Whores In This House.” The song’s raunchy lyrics detail Cardi and Megan’s sexual fantasies.  According to Cardi, the song is so explicit Atlantic Records was worried about its release, and even asked Cardi to put Megan on a different song:  When [the label] heard the song they were like, “We really like it, but that song is so explicit.” … They were like, “Can you please get another record and you could put Megan on it?” And I was like, “No.”  Like other sex-positive songs by female artists, these lyrics sparked online controversy. However, they were also widely praised for their message of female empowerment and sexual liberation.  The pair first revealed the song on August 3, 2020, with an announcement that the music video would premiere alongside its release three days later.",20.0,506.0,15493313.0

In an August 2017 Billboard interview, Cardi revealed that she wrote the lyrics to the song while listening to the beat on an airplane:  I heard the beat […] on the airplane, I kept writing to it.",25.0,407.0,7961769.0

It’s the third single from Invasion of Privacy, following after “Bodak Yellow” and “Bartier Cardi.”  There was speculation that the song was aimed at fiancé Offset, who was plagued by cheating rumors in late 2017 but in an April 2018 interview with Ebro on Beats 1, Cardi revealed she wasn’t:  No, I wasn’t talkin’ about Offset, I was just talkin’ about things I relate to and that have happened to me. First of all, I heard the record before I even was in love with Offset like that.  Soon after the song’s release, an old video surfaced of songwriter, Pardison Fontaine rapping similar lyrics over the same beat, which led to others accusing Cardi of stealing. In actuality, Pardison and Cardi are friends (since 2014) and is credited as a writer of the song under the alias Jordan Thorpe.",11.0,180.0,2295313.0

I started going out with this girl for about four months. She told me she was pregnant, so I’m thinking it’s mine. At first I was buggin’ like, “Damn, I don’t want a baby.”  And then one day she disappeared on me, then I seen a picture with her and some nigga, she was pregnant and shit. I was just thinking like, “Damn this bitch really did me wrong.”   Although the song tells the story of getting angry after getting played by a sweetheart, in the end A Boogie’s romantic side shines through as he repeats the song title over and over: “I still think about you…”  In an interview with XXL, A Boogie described this track as “one of the five hits” on his debut mixtape, Artist. Revolt described it as an example of A Boogie’s “rare versatility and style that is freeflowing and allows for him to dance over […] lines of R&B”.",2.0,100.0,1930985.0

This was followed on November 21st, 2019 by a new, higher budget video via Vevo, directed by Adam Powell.  The song is blackbear’s spin on the #hotgirlsummer trend. Megan Thee Stallion fans, who originated the trend, inspiring the song “Hot Girl Summer” reacted negatively to the song, claiming that blackbear appropriated the idea. blackbear, however, claimed the song “has to do [with] the caption trend” and doesn’t parody the song. In fact, he teased the song and title during July 2019, before the release of Megan’s “Hot Girl Summer” on August 9th, 2019.  On the cover art of this playful, energetic track, Maddy Crum, who was previously featured in Aidan Cullen-directed short film, THE ANONYMOUS SAGA, is pictured with a face covered in colorful stickers and a nosebleed.

It was put together just after he got engaged with her in Israel.  Hannah Lee previously inspired his debut album “Montevallo”, as well as the apologetic song “Drinkin  Too Much”.  Sam said  I’ve been taking songwriting a little too serious lately. With this lighthearted song I just wanted to do the opposite. The past songs I’ve written were less optimist than the ones I’m doing right now.  “Body Like A Back Road” is Sam Hunt’s most successful song to date. In June 2017, it broke a 55-year-old record held by Leroy Van Dyke’s “Walk On By” after Hunt’s track spent 20 weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. The song peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.",2.0,45.0,308665.0

I realize the power of the Internet because I, as a listener, found lots of great music through YouTube and other outlets that you can access through the Internet, but I had never taken advantage of it as an artist and that was the first song that I put up and was able to sort of gauge a reaction from that. Nobody knew who I was. I never wanted to charge anybody through YouTube. I just wanted to share it with them and kind of get the thing going, get the music out there; that’s the most important part. You can tour, but if you don’t have any music available, nobody can find your songs anywhere. There’s really nothing to hold onto after they go to a concert.",2.0,21.0,57816.0

He loves cactuses”, before singing the hook of Travis Scott’s “90210.” The following day, Travis tweeted the lyrics of this song’s hook, essentially confirming that he was featured on the track. Over the following days, Trippie continuously teased the song on Instagram, saying that he was waiting for Travis to send back his verse.  On November 29, Trippie uploaded another video to Instagram, teasing Travis  part to the song. Trippie originally hinted on the post that he would release the song after the post receives 100,000 comments saying “1400/800”, however, it was deleted later that night. Not long before it was deleted, Travis Tweeted about leaks with several angry emojis, leading some to believe that was the reason why Trippie deleted the video.  The song was released on December 5, 2017, and marks the first collaboration between the two artists.  The title seems to be a reference to the groundbreaking 2008 Christoper Nolan Batman film, “The Dark Knight.” It also seems to make reference to 6ix9ine’s “Gummo,” which is where the ‘Dummo’ from the title comes from. They were recently engaged in beef after they had a fight backstage at ‘Day ‘N Night’ festival.  It’s also worth noting that the melody that Trippie uses in the hook is very reminiscent of the melody he used on XXXTENTACION’s “Fuck Love.”",18.0,153.0,844534.0

The character is unfulfilled by a hedonistic life of consumerism, substance abuse, and adultery. He also has dissatisfaction with the indolence of his peers, feeling no need to heed their advice. With nothing left to believe in or follow, the rider heads out with the only destination being the open road.  “Old Town Road” grew in popularity through numerous TikTok memes. Similarly to how the Atlanta duo iLOVEFRiDAY’s hit song “Mia Khalifa” blew up, clips on TikTok with the hashtag #oldtownroad have garnered millions of views.  After the song was removed from Billboard’s Country charts for “not (embracing) enough elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version,” Lil Nas X released a remix of his song with Billy Ray Cyrus to spite the company. The original eventually reached the number 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 on April 8, 2019.  Both the original version and the remix credits Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails for sampling their track, “34 Ghosts IV.”",6.0,242.0,2344143.0

The song’s title references Lil Nas X’s real name, Montero Lamar Hill.  The track first surfaced as a snippet on Twitter in July 9th, 2020. In November of the same year, Nas X stated that “Call Me By Your Name” would be the next song he releases, announced via Instagram Live.  On February 2nd, 2021, a Super Bowl ad for Logitech starring Nas X was released, using the song. It was revealed in the ad’s description that the song was called “Montero (Call Me By Your Name).”  Lil Nas X later partnered with MSCHF, a company that makes viral products, to make a special edition of Nike Air Max 97s, known as the “Satan Shoes.” The shoes sold out in under a minute and the final pair, #666, is being given out via a Twitter lottery. They were priced at $1,018, a reference to the Bible passage Luke 10:18, which reads: “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.”    The release of the shoes, as well as the music video for the track, which sees Nas sliding down a pole into Hell and grinding on the Devil, garnered controversy among religious and conservative groups. However, the backlash only helped the song’s popularity.",10.0,249.0,1195837.0

Nas explained what he meant by the song in a Genius suggestion:  Panini was possessive over Chowder in the show. She’s a representation of fans of who love you when you’re small.

When tweeting about their relationship, Ariana states that Mac’s “inability to keep his shit together” was a significant reason why the relationship broke down and “Self Care” could also be Mac’s way of trying to learn from that mistake.  In the music video that was released along with the single, Mac is buried in a pine box to symbolize how the media tried to assassinate his character. In the casket, Mac lights a cigarette despite having no source of oxygen, displaying that he is confident that he will overcome his obstacles and make it out. With his knife, he carves “memento mori” into the lid which translates to “remember that you have to die” and he punches through it to save himself, a symbol showing that he refuses to die any time soon.",9.0,246.0,1287775.0

It is also the first single from Miller’s sixth studio album and first posthumous project, Circles. The track first appeared online on September 1, 2019. At the time, it was rumored to be part of an unreleased project that Miller was working on around the time of the release of his fifth studio album Swimming in August 2018. It was later released, along with an accompanying music video, and finally confirmed to be on his posthumous album, Circles, on January 9, 2020.  On the track, Miller discusses many of the same themes seen on his last record, Swimming. He speaks on feeling no reprieve from negative feelings in life, while the people around him only want him to say that he’s good, wanting him to suppress the negative feelings he has all the time.  The track’s music video features clips of Miller recording music, as well as many animated nature scapes depicting the positive parts of the world that Miller wants to find on the track.",2.0,170.0,1136694.0

Lyrically, Mendes sings to his romantic interest, promising to be a better boyfriend than the one she currently has. There was some speculation that this song was about Camila Cabello, the Fifth Harmony member who was rumored to have been dating Mendes in 2016. Both of them, however, insist that they’re just friends.  In Seventeen, Mendes did talk about how he’s matured since his last album, referencing a past relationship:  I have songs about growing up, about ex-relationships—ex-relationship, I should say. I haven’t had relationships. A couple of songs about relationships with girls since fame.  This song’s instrumentation is heavy on guitar. Teddy Geiger and Scott Harris helped pen the lyrics (they were behind two of the major hits on Mendes  previous album Handwritten). Gieger contributed to production alongside Dan Romer, a veteran in the music industry who’s also worked with film, most notably scoring 2011’s Beasts of the Southern Wild.",2.0,122.0,1203576.0

The track is CORPSE’s first major collab since the release of his breakthrough singles “E-GIRLS ARE RUINING MY LIFE!” and “agoraphobic”.  In supernatural fantasy, a ‘daywalker’ is a vampire that can walk in sunlight unaffected. They can sustain extended periods in sunlight and even has traces of a soul. Usually, vampires burn under sunlight and are known primarily as ‘nightcrawlers’. A more well-known version of the daywalker is the Marvel Comics character Blade.  Since December 2020, both CORPSE and MGK had been teasing an upcoming collaboration during live streams and via brief snippets on Twitter, but the song’s full reveal came on March 9th, when both artists posted the song’s cover art to social media.  The song serves as a return to form for Machine Gun Kelly, after the success of his #1 pop-punk album Tickets To My Downfall, while still allowing him to branch into new directions as he fuses his own rock sound with CORPSE’s signature style of horror-core rap.  A music video for the track dropped on March 18th. Since CORPSE has not done an official face-reveal, his lines were performed and lip-synched by fellow YouTuber/streamer VALKYRAE.",4.0,145.0,448169.0

But a select few include The Grand Ole Opry and at the 2017 CMA’S according to Wide Open Country and Billboard  Old Dominion’s frontman Matthew Ramsey told Nash Country Daily “No matter who you are, where you live or your current status, people both old and young face more challenges than ever. It’s in the face of those challenges and standing at the edge of fear that we have to remain positive. Focus on the light that comes from positivity instead of being swallowed up. Work hard at doing what you feel is right. Don’t be scared!! Live life like there’s no such thing as a broken heart.”",3.0,15.0,66817.0

The song was written by Stevie Nicks at a turbulent time for the band.  She and Lindsey Buckingham’s relationship was coming to an end.  Christine McVie was in the process of divorcing her husband, band member John McVie and drummer Mick Fleetwood was in the process of divorce from his wife as well.  Buckingham’s “Go Your Own Way” can be considered a companion piece to “Dreams” as it details the other side of the breakup from his perspective.  Audio engineer Ken Caillat recalls the origin of the song,   Most of the material for the album was composed in the studio but Stevie used to get bored, sitting around while all the technical stuff was going on, so she asked if there was a room with a piano to noodle around on.  Well, the Record Plant told her she could use Sly Stone’s studio — a little sunken room that they’d built for him to work in — and one day while we were working on some track, she came in and said, ‘I’ve just written the most amazing song.’ ‘Really? Let’s hear it.’  So, she walked over to the Rhodes — which, like everything else, was always mic’d up and ready to go — and she played ‘Dreams’. Everyone else joined in, she did a guide vocal, and that was the keeper. It’s the only time that ever happened. She tried to redo the vocal again and again, but she could never beat the original. I actually wanted her to beat it, because it had the drums leaking into her vocal mic and, in a couple of spots where she sang softly, I had to ride it up and you could hear even more of the snare. Still, it was a one-off.",19.0,80.0,943797.0

It can also be seen as the chain that keeps the band together; linking the members together in ways that don’t allow them to truly part ways. Written in a time when the band members were not on talking terms due to breakups and rifts in the relationships they had, the lyrics are often said to have been attacks at each other, but the band also suggests that there is some underlying love that doesn’t let them completely part ways.    In 2017, 40 years after the song’s release, it was used in blockbusters Marvel Studio’s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” and Margot Robbie’s “I, Tonya” as part of the movies  soundtracks.",9.0,72.0,554941.0
Landslide,Fleetwood Mac,"[Verse 1] I took my love, took it down I climbed a mountain, and I turned around And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills Till the landslide brought me down  [Verse 2] Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love? Can the child within my heart rise above? Can I sail through the changing ocean tides? Can I handle the seasons of my life? Hmmmm  [Chorus] Well, I ve been afraid of changing  Cause I ve built my life around you But time makes you bolder, even children get older And I m getting older too  [Guitar Solo]  [Chorus] Well, I ve been afraid of changing  Cause I ve built my life around you But time makes you bolder, even children get older And I m getting older too Oh, I m getting older too  [Verse 1 (variation)] I take my love, take it down Oh, climb a mountain and turn around And If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills Well, the landslide will bring you down  [Outro] And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills Well, the landslide will bring you down Oh, the landslide will bring it down","Nicks wrote “Landslide” while in Aspen, Colorado, inspired, while looking at the mountains, by the thought that everything in her life she’d been building could come crashing down at any time. It became a tale of love and life artfully woven behind the metaphor of a snowy mountain avalanche,  It was never originally released as a single (“Over My Head”, “Rhiannon” & “Say You Love Me” were the album’s three top 20 hits), but is considered one of the most known and cherished songs of the band’s decades-long career. In 1998, a live recording of the song reached #51 in the US.",7.0,60.0,521362.0

It was included as the B-side to the album’s lead single, “Go Your Own Way,” to which it’s something of a response.  Years later, the song drove a deeper wedge in an already strained relationship between Nicks and drummer Mick Fleetwood. Nicks sought to include it on a greatest hits package of her own material, but Fleetwood wanted it for a box of material celebrating the band’s first 25 years.  During the reconciliation for The Dance, the tune re-emerged, finding new life in its live version and emerging as a late-career hit for the band.  A road sign for Silver Spring, Maryland, helped inspire Nicks to write the song.",8.0,28.0,409313.0

Lanez has mentioned on numerous occasions that he is coming for the number one spot no matter who’s there. Many would argue that Drake currently holds that position. The remix may have been made with the intention to provoke fans to decide who did a better job on the beat, hence, determining who is the better artist.  Following the 10 second snippet posted on Snapchat, Tory Lanez dropped the “Controlla” remix along with the “I Got The Keys (Remix).”  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqYGbgG9_7I",7.0,52.0,355929.0

Just like “Outro” and “Green Lights,” NF tweeted the first letter of the track—in this case, “L,” which could have been alluding either to “Let You Down” or “Lie.” Nine minutes later, he tweeted out the letter “E,” largely supporting the thought of it being “Let You Down.” The track was later officially confirmed to be “Let You Down” through a separate tweet.  “Let You Down” hit No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 song charts, marking his first song to even hit the Top 20. It also hit No. 12 on Spotify’s Global Top 50 airing with over 2 million plays a day, and No. 6 on Spotify’s Global Top 50.  The track is the third and final single off of NF’s third studio album, Perception.

It was released a week after the first promotional single, “The Heart Part 4,” with a music video directed by Dave Meyers and The Little Homies. It features religious imagery mixed with urban life, such as Kendrick in priest’s robes and a moving re-enactment of Leonardo Da Vinci’s painting The Last Supper—juxtaposing this with the concept of humility in the chorus.  On a religious note, the song could also be a reference to the verse James 4:7.  So humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.""  —Thus linking to April 7th, the date Kendrick told the industry to have their shit together.  Mike WiLL Made-It produced the beat. It features a deep piano riff and a banging 808 bass line. This style of production is a departure from the sound of Kendrick’s previous jazz-influenced project, To Pimp a Butterfly. It seems to reference the character Deebo’s theme song from the popular comedy movie Friday (1995). Kendrick is also shown riding through the neighborhood on a bicycle in the music video, similar to Deebo in Friday.  The song debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 on April 22, 2017, making it not only the highest charting song for Kendrick, but also one of the highest debuting hip-hop singles since “Love the Way You Lie” by Eminem. The song later hit No. 1 on the chart on June 5, 2017, making it Lamar’s first No. 1 song and second No. 1 song overall on the charts.",19.0,946.0,10876761.0

Kendrick’s recent beat-down brings back early memories of similar situations, witnessing someone with their brains blown out at a burger stand back when he was 9 (probably referring to his Uncle Tony, or someone in a similar situation), he thinks he knows the person who did it but he censors their name. He also talks about how his cousin was killed back in ‘94.  He talks about his father telling him to get a job but he’s fired after his friends pressure him into staging a robbery. He gives his reason for why he doesn’t smoke when he tells a story of smoking marijuana laced with cocaine and “foaming at the mouth.”  In the final verse he tries to let the good shine through and offer respite for the youth and how they don’t have to succumb to the temptations and pressures of the street. He hopes that his experience and intelligence can do good for the youth living in similar situations.",80.0,657.0,6655083.0

These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!","On this lead single from good kid, m.A.A.d city, Kendrick addresses the psychological connection between peer pressure and alcoholism. What sounds like a club anthem is actually an introspective take on the social pressure and self-defeating attitudes that drive people to drink.  The theme of swimming in pools as a metaphor for drinking and alcoholism could be a reference to the 1964 short story “The Swimmer” by author John Cheever.  K-Dot spoke to Complex about the inspiration behind this song:  What better way to make something universal than to speak about drinking? I’m coming from a household where you had to make a decision—you were either a casual drinker or you were a drunk. That’s what that record is really about, me experiencing that as a kid and making my own decisions.  The radio version of “Swimming Pools (Drank)” ends here.",44.0,438.0,5989162.0

In the music video, Kendrick and actor Don Cheadle appear to trade bars, engaging in an argument using the song’s lyrics during an interrogation scene. We also learn that “DNA” stands for “Dead Nigger Association.”  Lamar is wearing a traditional Kung Fu uniform throughout the piece. In an interview with Pitchfork, Don Cheadle confirmed that he inadvertently inspired the ‘Kung Fu Kenny’ persona. Cheadle portrayed a Chinese-speaking martial artist named Kenny in the 2001 action-comedy sequel Rush Hour 2.    At the beginning of the video, the song “YAH.” can be heard echoing above—almost as if it is playing in Kendrick’s head as the camera pans down. “YAH.” comes directly after “DNA.” on DAMN.’s tracklist.  Following his initial encounter with Cheadle, who seems to be portraying a law enforcement figure, the ending of “BLOOD.” suddenly begins playing; when Cheadle turns on the lie-detector device, he begins convulsing, almost as if in a trance. This snippet comes from the video of Geraldo Rivera criticizing Kendrick’s lyrics on “Alright,” one of his most successful singles. The music video also contains snippets from “Hood Politics,” another song from Lamar’s March 2015 award-winning album, To Pimp A Butterfly.  Lastly, the song’s second verse samples a different segment of the same Fox News clip from “BLOOD.” and it’s worth noting that “BLOOD.” precedes “DNA.” on the album.",36.0,596.0,5665282.0

Just bring the car back! Kendrick’s Dad: Did somebody say dominoes?","As explained in this, credits to Feeding Time of KTT for this summary.  K.Dot recaps the story so far. He talks about robbing the house, “Home invasion was persuasive/From 9 to 5 I know its vacant.” He mentions fucking Sherane and bragging about it to his homies, “I fucked Sherane then went to tell my bros.” He references “Backseat Freestyle” when he talks about rhyming to beats, “Park the car then we started rhyming, ya bish/The only thing we had to free our mind.” And he talks about jumping dudes who looked like they had more money than them, “Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs/You looking like an easy come up ya bish/A silver spoon I know you come from ya bish."" The line in the chorus “Everybody gon  respect the shooter/But the one in front of the gun lives forever.” is deeply important, not just as a life motto, but in regards to the events that later take place in this story regarding Dave and his brother. It’s also a reference to Kendrick’s Uncle Tony, who was shot and killed at Louie’s Burgers; this event is a snap back to reality from the “dreams of living life like rappers do.”  A sequel to this song, titled “Money Trees Deuce,” was released on Jay Rock’s 2015 album, 90059.",43.0,464.0,5303444.0

Liz is compared to the famous portrait painting due to the dubiety of Mona Lisa’s smile. The smile can be interpreted as disingenuous, which therefore makes Liz disingenuous as well, unbeknownst to the boyfriend. Wayne and Kendrick play the two sides of the story; Wayne is the robber and Kendrick is the boyfriend.  The song was originally recorded in 2014, as it appeared on the tentative Carter V tracklist that Wayne previewed in October 2014. The first snippet of the song was brought to light in 2017 when PharmaBro Martin Shkreli played a part of the song live on Periscope, after acquiring the album from a man who bought Lil Wayne’s Bugatti, where a copy of the album was left. The version that Shkreli played live was later leaked in September 2019, along with the rest of the original Carter V album.   The song also notably contains references to Wayne’s relationship with Karrine Steffans, who is also known as Superhead. In an interview with BET Digital shortly after the song’s release, Steffans confirmed this, noting the song’s lyrics bared “similarities” to her relationship with Wayne.",24.0,450.0,1978592.0

In the vulnerable ballad, Demi can be heard crying for help as she talks about wanting someone to be there through the tough times with her.  Speaking to Zane Lowe in an interview on Apple Music’s New Music Daily, Demi recalled that no one had helped her with her struggles back when she wrote and recorded the song days before her drug overdose back in July of 2018:   I almost listen back and hear these lyrics as a cry for help. [And] you kind of think, “How did nobody listen to this song and think, ‘Let’s help this girl’.”  [Back then,] I was recording [the song] in a state of mind where I felt like I was OK — but clearly I wasn’t. I even listen back to it and I’m like, “Gosh, I wish I could go back in time to help that version of myself.”   Lovato’s GRAMMY performance of the track was first teased back in December 4, 2019, via Instagram with the caption, “The next time you hear from me, I’ll be singing….” Weeks later, on January 14, 2020, her performance of the then-unnamed song was announced.  According to the ‘music insider’ who had correctly confirmed Lovato’s GRAMMY performance, the song will not serve as the lead single from her upcoming seventh studio album. This was previously pointed out by fans after discovering that the song has not been officially sent to radio.",3.0,69.0,377606.0

Produced by Chicago-native d.a. got that dope, this track heavily features steel drum instrumentation.  Following “If I’m Lyin, I’m Flyin” two weeks prior, this is Kodak’s second single since being released from jail in August 2018 and the second single from Dying to Live.  In early September 2018, Kodak posted a now-deleted short clip of him and Travis Scott dancing to the song’s instrumental in the studio. This video became a viral sensation known as the #WaitingChallenge that inspired numerous memes. Kodak later posted another video of just himself dancing to the instrumental.  Kodak performed during the Florida A&M University homecoming festivities on October 5, 2018, and announced the song’s name and release date. One day before the song’s release, Kodak posted the cover art, which revealed that Offset was on the song, which was previously unknown. The song was released as expected on October 12, 2018.  The official music video was released on November 23, 2018. Travis Scott directed the video by himself. The video depicts the three rappers having a problem with the original film director, and hence things are the way they are. It is basically a behind-the-scenes twisted video, showing the three under a green screen and editing their effects.",31.0,230.0,1196545.0

The girl he raps about on the track originally didn’t want Tjay, but as soon as he blew up, she came back begging for him. Tjay knew she only wanted him for the fame, so he leaves her in his crime-filled past.  Additionally, he sarcastically samples and interpolates Justin Bieber’s January 2010 smash hit “Baby“ to show how he could’ve bought the girl anything if she was with him from the start.  Initially, the track wasn’t released on streaming services due to Tjay being unable to clear the “Baby” sample at the time so he, instead, released it to his YouTube on July 30, 2018.  More than two years later, on December 1, 2020, Tjay announced in an Instagram post that Bieber had finally granted him permission to release it on streaming services.

The song reached #1 on Billboard’s Country Songs chart after Stapleton performed it as a duet with Justin Timberlake at the 2015 CMA Awards.  Ironically (given Stapleton’s notoriety as a songwriter), ”Tennessee Whiskey” is a cover of a country classic—it was a minor hit for David Allan Coe in 1981, and a major hit for George Jones in 1983.  Many have also noted the updated arrangement’s resemblance to Etta James  1968 R&B classic “I’d Rather Go Blind” (a song Beyoncé covered in the 2008 movie Cadillac Records).  Stapleton recalled the cover’s genesis in an interview with Fader:   It’s always been a favorite song of mine. We had a show in Charlottesville, and we were sound checking, waiting around for the mics to get set up. Me and the guys in the band started playing a little bit and got into that groove, so I started thinking, “Man, what song could I sing over top of this?“ For whatever reason, I started singing “Tennessee Whiskey.”  At the time, we had a steel player by the name of Steve Hinson who used to play with George Jones on the road—maybe that was part of the equation. But we decided to do the song that night and every night since. By the time we got into the studio, it was something we all enjoyed playing. It’s a part of the fabric of things that influenced me over the years.",7.0,29.0,507804.0

I didn’t include any songs I’d written with him on Traveller, so it was really important to me … to cut songs from some of the guys who helped me learn how to write songs, and Mike is one of those guys.

Billie Jean is","One of Michael Jackson’s signature songs, “Billie Jean” tells the tale of a young girl who claims to be the mother of Jackson’s alleged son. The song was the second single from his sixth solo album Thriller. It reached #1 in 7 countries.  In an interview with Martin Bashir, Michael revealed his original inspiration behind “Billie Jean”, sharing, “I said to myself beforehand, ‘I wanna write a song with a great bass hook.’” He was driving down Ventura Boulevard when he came up with that hook.  In his autobiography, Moonwalk, Jackson wrote:  There never was a real Billie Jean. The girl in the song is a composite of people my brothers have been plagued with over the years. I could never understand how these girls could say they were carrying someone’s child when it wasn’t true.  One peculiar case where this happened to Jackson himself was in 1981 when a woman wrote him letters claiming he was the father of ONE of her twins. She initially appears on the first song of the album, “Wanna Be Startin  Somethin .”  Producer Quincy Jones originally did not want to include “Billie Jean” on Thriller. He disliked the intro, the bass line and song’s title (feeling listeners would associate the track with tennis legend Billie Jean King). Jackson fought to keep the song on the album, and not change its title to Jones  suggestion of “Not My Lover”.  Despite Jackson’s claim in a 2002 interview that the song’s bass line came ‘from above’, Daryl Hall has said Jackson once told him he’d stolen the groove of “Billie Jean” from Hall & Oates  song “I Can’t Go For That (No Can Do)”.  The song was notably performed by MJ on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever in 1983, where he debuted the Moonwalk to rave reviews. Fred Astaire even called the day after to give him props, saying, “Man, you really put them on their asses last night.”  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLdwOrmuc0M",15.0,206.0,1305679.0

When he didn’t like the original sketching of the concept, he decided to make it a gangster scene instead. From there he wrote basic lyrics to go along with the idea he had for the musical hook.  There have been some critics who state that it’s overly simplistic. They, as usual, miss the entire point. It was meant to be a song with a hook and a basic story and nothing more. It was created from the beginning as a pure video song.  “Smooth Criminal” was an international smash hit, topping the chart in Spain, Belgium & The Netherlands and reaching the top 10 in several others including a #7 peak in the US. The song is also remembered for the dance routine in its music video, which includes an “anti-gravity lean” with the help of anchors in the floor that the dancers  shoes locked into.",6.0,147.0,1199843.0

According to Epic Records notes, the song was written in part by Michael for his sister LaToya as a response to negative reports about her relationship with her sisters, but Michael recorded it himself. Released on its own on May 8, 1983, “Wanna Be Startin  Somethin ” went #1 in Canada and the Netherlands and cracked in the Top 40 in 13 regions. It charted again in Denmark, Italy and Switzerland in 2008 following the release of its successful remix for Thriller 25, and at #25 in America following Jackson’s death on June 25, 2009.  The iconic outro of the song, repeating the Cameroonian phrase “Mama Se, Mama Sa, Ma Makusa” has never been outright defined. A lawsuit decided that Jackson (and Rihanna, who sampled the song for “Don’t Stop the Music”) had illegally sampled “Soul Makossa” by Manu DiBango, released in 1972 that was popular in the underground New York disco scene.  When Thriller opens, those 100 million sales feel just. “Wanna Be Startin  Somethin ” is pure confused, shocked teenage rush. So there’s another theory: Thriller is the best-selling record ever because it’s the best record ever. That one holds up for six minutes and two seconds, during which Jackson and Quincy Jones mix the tension of rock n roll with the rapture of disco and hit perfection.  — Pitchfork",13.0,79.0,659674.0

The idea behind the song was inspired by watching a home video of Max and Spencer Ernst (both are band members) jumping on a trampoline. They wanted to tell a story that played along with their surrounding environment outside of their home. This story was focused around the idea of the “Upside Down” (a Stranger Things reference), and they wanted the plot to be similar to Alice In Wonderland.",0.0,69.0,397930.0

The Bronx rapper drops bars woven between Bruno’s crooning over a 90’s style beat. The original track was released on Bruno’s 2016 album 24K Magic, which spawned three Hot 100 singles. With his throwback star power and Cardi’s fire bars, the track is destined for success as well.  On Instagram, Bruno revealed how “the one and only” Cardi’s verse came to be and gave her some advice:  I met Cardi B at 3 am after my show in LA backstage where we recorded her verse for Finesse. She walked in the room and she was everything I’d hope she’d be. Never change cardi! Don’t let this crazy music business change who you are. You posses something that can’t be taught. You’re a true star. Thank you for putting your energy and love all over this record and video.  Cardi has recently collaborated with many artists, accumulating millions of streams and breaking records along the way, so it’s likely that this remix will be another addition to her successes. She went to Instagram to convey her gratitude.  The song debuted in the #35 spot and then jumped up to #3 the following week on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart.  They performed during the 60th Grammy Awards on January 28th, 2018, mashed up with a verse of Cardi B’s “Bartier Cardi.”",8.0,163.0,2553307.0

In a Beats 1 interview, Sam explained that only four songs on the album are about them, and “Too Good at Goodbyes” is one of them. They told Zane Lowe how the song was inspired by a real relationship:  [The song is] about a relationship I was in and it’s basically about getting good at getting dumped. […] I’m still very, very single. I think I’m even more single than I was when I released In the Lonely Hour.  They also said,  At the time I was trying to convince myself I was tough, to protect myself. I was gearing up for what I knew would happen. I’m really not like that at all.  In an interview with Nick Grimshaw on BBC Radio 1 on the morning the song dropped, Nick introduced Sam by saying that “the vibes around Sam have definitely changed,” and Sam agreed. They explained that the album, due in November, is a tribute to the family and friends who supported them over the years, focusing on ‘their lives — their ups and downs’, rather than Sam’s own.",1.0,239.0,7709725.0

One of their biggest hits, it’s gone #1 in countries like the United States, Canada, and Ireland, and even won two Grammy awards.  Written with Jimmy Napes and Tourist in Old Street, London studio, Smith claimed “the song just flowed out of us so naturally.” When Tourist played the first three chords, Napes quickly added a drum layer, and the rest of the track took only 30-40 minutes to write.  Upon the track’s release, listeners noticed similarities between “Stay With Me” and Tom Petty’s 1989 hit “I Won’t Back Down.” Smith’s team said that this was purely coincidental, but agreed to give Petty co-writer credits, and Petty stated that he has no ill feelings for Smith.  The music video was directed by Jamie Thraves, who also directed the music videos for Smith’s “Money On My Mind,” Radiohead’s “Just,” Coldplay’s “The Scientist,” by and Death Cab for Cutie’s “I Will Follow You into the Dark.” It features Sam walking down the street in Hackney, London, among other settings.",4.0,76.0,1600845.0

The song follows lead single “Too Good at Goodbyes”, which dropped just four weeks earlier.  The song combines strong gospel influnces with a hip hop beat, courtesy of Timbaland, who co-produced the song with Jimmy Napes.  Smith told Billboard that “Pray” was inspired by a visit to Iraq:  I spent five days in Mosul and came back ­embarrassed that I had known so little about the world and other people’s lives…I wanted to write about what is going on in the rest of the world, and that it’s not always pretty.  The tone of the lyric is searingly self-critical; a ‘coming-of-age’ song involving feelings of shame, guilt, newly raised awareness, and ultimately some degree of trust in whatever Power they feel might exist.  It is also a markedly intelligent song, indicating Sam’s grasp of the shortcomings and immaturity of many young people, and the shocks and processes that lead to self-growth and a compassionate outlook.  Sam Smith performed the song at the 2018 Grammy Awards.",9.0,76.0,903066.0

Much of In the Lonely Hour deals with a case of unrequited love Smith suffered when they fell for a straight man and thus not interested in their advances. The singer explained during their performance at the O2 Academy in Brixton, London that they wrote “Lay Me Down” after deleting the unresponsive man from thier social media account.  Smith explained to MTV News how this was the song that kick-started their music career:  “Disclosure heard ‘Lay Me Down,’ and (after that) it was like a domino effect,” he said. “We wrote ‘Latch’ together, and then Naughty Boy heard ‘Latch’ and we wrote ‘La La La’ together, and then I had a number-one single in the UK.”  The song was re-recorded for a 2015 re-release following Smith’s commercial success. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaMq2nn5ac0",1.0,93.0,751013.0

However, one decided that they did not care.  The song serves to empower women above the idea of a man as the center to all of their actions. In positioning all the women in this one man’s life as being aware of what they want from him, it diffuses his lies to them and makes him look like the foolish one.  The rather artistic and simple music video (released on December 21, 2017) is directed by Solange and features SZA in different settings moving to the song. The video also features words at the bottom of the screen that are not lyrics, but are still important to the song’s theme:  One opted out An imbalance of power, shifted the whole tide It waved And waved  The cover art for the single was designed by SZA’s friend Sage Adams and is inspired by Henri Matisse’s “The Dance.”",4.0,116.0,2418383.0

The song was also featured in the second trailer released for the film, and used throughout the film as a motif of Gatsby and Daisy’s relationship.  According to Del Rey:  It was an honor to work with Baz Lurhmann on his amazing adaptation of one of the most extraordinary books ever written. The movie is highly glamorous and exciting; Rick Nowels and I were thrilled to write the song for the film.  “Young and Beautiful” was penned by Lana and the film’s director, co-writer, and co-producer Baz Luhrmann, for the soundtrack. Del Rey wrote an earlier version of the song for her Paradise EP, but re-worked it with Luhrmann after he heard it and decided it’d work great with the movie. The song served as the film’s kickoff single, and an “orchestral single” featuring an orchestra was also released. Its motif, as well as samples of it, can be heard throughout the film and its soundtrack.  A jazz version of the song, created by the Bryan Ferry Orchestra, can be heard in the background of the scene that introduces Daisy.",17.0,132.0,1647897.0

This song became a sleeper success from a dance remix by Cedric Gervais. The remix entered the Top 50 in the UK, the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, and it topped the US Dance/Electronic songs chart.    The accompanying music video created great speculation over its underlying message. It depicts a tragedy where one woman (played by Lana Del Rey) jumps and the other (Jamie King), heartbroken, follows. Due to this, some claim that the song was written for a personal friend of Lana’s that committed suicide, or that it was written for a boyfriend that died years ago. However, there is absolutely no evidence of this, and many believe these speculations to be false in their entirety.",10.0,129.0,1168071.0

Olivia questions both the authenticity of her ex’s new relationship, as well as their emotions for their new girl. She also portrays feelings of pity towards this new girl, who is not experiencing anything unique with her now-lover.  Despite sharing similar themes, “deja vu” is musically different from “drivers license,” with a more upbeat melody. It shows influences from Taylor Swift, both melodically and lyrically, especially in the bridge and outro. The music video shows a girl—presumably her ex’s new girlfriend, played by actress Talia Ryder—slowly replacing Olivia, literally and figuratively. To her disbelief, this new girl is reliving her exact same experiences, copying her until she finally completely replaces Olivia.  In the week preceding its release, Olivia cleared all of her posts on her Instagram account and began posting a series of cryptic videos, showing various clips on an analog television. Three of these teasers were shared before the official announcement of the song on March 29, 2021. The day before its release, Olivia posted an acoustic snippet of the song on TikTok.",7.0,127.0,327625.0

In an interview with Billboard Pop Shop talked about what the song was about and what it was like to work with one of their favorite artists, Rivers Cuomo. Being a huge fan of Rivers for their entire career, they were floored to when he complimented their song, “Weak”. They added that they thought the appeal to “Sober Up” from a fan’s perspective must have been from the universal theme of simplistic times in a person’s life.  We did our first couple of semesters at Columbia, we were experiencing the whole college vibe, going to parties and doing that sort of thing. And then there was a time where we just started getting depressed a little bit. We started getting sad because we felt a little bit too grown up, because one of the things we kind of pride ourselves on is staying young and having that little-kid experience.",4.0,45.0,322347.0

Madison expressed the song’s writing process to Paper Magazine saying:  Charli XCX is one of the writers on it. She was so incredible to work with, and we had so much fun. I wanted to do something… that we kind of were like, when you break up with someone you hope they see you doing really well, and I hope it hurts like hell. I hope you realize that you should have given me the love that I deserve, and that you messed up. Offset’s verse was really important, that he captured that as well. I wanted to make sure it felt like we were both ganging up on the same person, and that we were both talking to the same guy. It came out exactly how we wanted it to you. I’m just really proud of it.  The music video for “Hurts Like Hell” was released on November 14 and featured Beer playing a witch. She was shown using magic to take revenge on an abusive man before getting caught up in a witch hunt. It was co-written and executively produced by Beer, who in a press release said:  I had such a clear vision of what I wanted to do for this video. I was inspired by witchcraft and felt that it perfectly fit with the theme of the song, which is about teaching someone a lesson.",1.0,60.0,207943.0

Florida Georgia Line rejected this song at first—they didn’t even listen to it all the way through. Singer Tyler Hubbard told ABC Radio: “A couple weeks later, we just were both kind of like, ‘Have you been listening to that “H.O.L.Y.,” that song?’ We both kind of fell in love with it over those few weeks of living with it, and realized the power. Sometimes a song doesn’t hit you right away.”  This song nearly went to an unbeliebable artist. busbee told Rolling Stone: “There was talk of Justin Bieber doing the song, and we had actually recorded it with another artist. Word came out that FGL were really into it—honestly we would’ve never thought to pitch that to them. We wrote it in L.A.; the other two writers are pop writers predominantly.”  Hubbard and his partner in Florida Georgia Line, singer Brian Kelley, were advised by their non-musical partners to do this song. Hubbard told Billboard: “There were three instances where our wives asked us about ‘H.O.L.Y.,’ and when we said we were considering it for FGL, they said we had to cut it.

Since then, the video has amassed over 25 million views on YouTube and compelled Tate to professionally record it and release it on streaming platforms. This new recording was released on December 28 of the same year.  Prior to the upload of this song, Tate would upload dance videos and vlogs, after placing runner up on So You Think You Can Dance, the Next Generation.

In an interview with outnowmagazine, Tate talked about the importance of the song:  ‘You broke me first’ is a really special song to me. This song is about someone in a relationship who couldn’t care less for the other person and then 6 months later decides to crawl back. It’s the feeling of knowing how much they meant to you, but this time not letting them back in. I hope everyone can connect to this song like I do.",0.0,74.0,277561.0

In one of her videos, she explained that this song is less of a jab to her parents, and more of an insult to herself:  I feel like, teenagers, when they don’t know how to figure themselves out, they blame it on their parents. Obviously.  Nevertheless, the parents are not entirely blameless either:  It’s kinda weird because our parents went through it before. Then why do they react to our choices like they’ve never heard of them before?  Tate tried to capture the disagreements with her parents and struggles with herself on this track. In the explanatory video, she pronounced her wish to write about how difficult it can be to be a teenager sometimes:  I have the most complicated mind ever, and I honestly never know what I am feeling. And I can never, ever, put it into words.",0.0,30.0,174278.0

[Outro] (Beluga Heights)","“Whatcha Say” is an apology song about a man who cheated on his girl and now feels sorry after being caught.  In an interview with Digital Spy, Jason mentioned that the song was based on his brother – “Basically my brother called me one day and said, ‘I cheated on my girl, but I love her so much and I hope she’ll give me one more shot’. I found his story really compelling, so I just went into the studio and tried it out. You know, people go through that kind of thing every day, which is why the song is so relatable. She did take my brother back though and they’re actually engaged now, so it all worked out good in the end.”  “Whatcha Say” became a huge success in late 2009, reaching the top of the Billboard charts on November 14.  (Fun Fact: This song was was originally written for Sean Kingston.)  Production-wise, “Whatcha Say” heavily samples Imogen Heap’s “Hide and Seek”.

I walked into the studio with my producers, Paul and Jason, and they asked “What’s going on in your world? How has it been?”, it was the first time we had written since “How Can It Be.” I was feeling overwhelmed that much had happened the night before. How do I come back down to normal? How do I come back down to reality?  This brought up the issue of identity and trying to figure out how to exist when I feel like so many things were pulling me in so many different directions. We pretty quickly finished the writing and demo recording that day.  Over the course of two years of touring, I would sing “You Say” every night.  I remember starting to hear fans sing along to a song that had never been heard before. When it came time to make the record, it was a really fun process to have the challenge presented with something that I felt like I’d been living with. I felt like I got to a place of expressing this song exactly how I wanted to sing it.",0.0,83.0,546703.0

The title refers to the Magnolia Projects, which fits the bouncy New Orleans-inspired production.  In March 2017, Carti previewed the song during his SXSW performance with producer Southside. On March 19, Carti went on Twitter to drop a promotional trailer for his debut mixtape, which featured a segment of the song as a backdrop. Later that day, Carti and Southside played the full song on Instagram Live.  During a June 2017 interview with The Fader, Pi erre Bourne discussed linking up with Carti and producing the song:  I made [Magnolia] in the car. […] People might not know the whole story going into the songs, but the beats I gave Carti I made day-of or the day before the session. All of March, we were cooking it up.  Since its release, “Magnolia” has received massive acclaim—it debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, and peaked at #29 in July 2017. Moreover, it has been certified 3x platinum by the RIAA.  The official music video dropped on July 10, 2017, featuring footage of Carti on the streets of New York, with cameo appearances from A$AP Rocky, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, and Don Q, among others.",18.0,212.0,2401310.0

The track features the classic hip-hop tropes of money, drugs and women. However, Carti expresses his frustration with the copycat genre throughout the chorus. One such imitator may be Smokepurpp, who copied the vocals and production of Carti’s 2014 single “Smash” in 2016. This song makes it clear that Carti and Uzi consider one and other as pioneers of the late 2010s generation of trap music.  This track marks the fourth released collaboration between Playboi Carti and Philadephia-born rapper Lil Uzi Vert. The song was released as a single along with “Lookin” (which featured Lil Uzi as well) prior to the release of Carti’s debut mixtape Playboi Carti.",17.0,197.0,906212.0

Being able to vent in “Save Myself”, in a way, as she often does in her music, is “liberating”, which makes total sense as by freeing all of her pent up angry feelings towards her ex (as well as to herself for ignoring the signs), she is saving herself now when she could not free herself from back then as quickly as she could have.",0.0,25.0,43974.0

Jonas has described the song as a song about when someone is checking out your girl and you’re out, and it’s that whole experience I think a lot of men relate to, but don’t actually talk about.  The time and place in which he was writing and recording this song also played an interesting role, as he was training for Kingdom.

For the first time in Nick’s highly regulated celebrity life, he’s solo. Besides experiencing the biggest break up of his life, he’s been the subject of celebrity gossip, played a gay MMA fighter on a TV show, and announced his own record label with his BFF, Demi Lovato. He’s stepping into adulthood and new artistic territory, and this song represents a step further in that trajectory.  Nick Jonas and Swedish singer-songwriter Tove Lo were friends. After performing at the Jingle Ball, Nick reached out and she hopped on the song. Tove told EW:  I’ve known Nick as a friend for a couple of years, and working with him was amazing. He’s very talented and I fell in love with the song as soon as I heard the demo.  This track has a roster of veteran pop-makers including songwriting credits from Tove,  Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter, and Swedish production duo Mattman and Robin (who also produced the track).  On March 21st, Nick sent out a video teaser for the song. The official video for the song was released on March 25, 2016. Describing it to Ryan Seacrest, he said: “I actually was just texting Tove—look, there’s gonna be some babies made to this song and they better be named after us.”",6.0,46.0,184116.0

On the track, the trio boast about their luxurious lifestyles; an influx in currency, exotic sport vehicles and excessive use in narcotics.

Out of respect, Taz Taylor later changed the track’s original title from “Kobe” to “Lost Me”.  Due to a problem with the artists and record labels in early 2020, the track was originally scrapped from the album as Taz Taylor explained in a tweet.  On April 21, 2020, all of the artists and labels reunited as iann dior confirmed the track was releasing soon. The track was confirmed to be featured on the collective Internet Money album, B4THESTORM.
